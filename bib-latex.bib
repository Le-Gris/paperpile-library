              a space of matrix decomposition models which can express a
              variety of widely used models from unsupervised learning. To
              enable model selection, we organize these models into a
              context-free grammar which generates a wide variety of structures
              through the compositional application of a few simple rules. We

              components and estimate predictive likelihood for nearly 2500
              structures using a small toolbox of reusable algorithms. Using a

              simpler models under heavy noise. It learns sensible structures

              the ability of DNNs to learn useful representations of
              high-dimensional inputs, a problem that humans must also solve.
              We examine the relationship between the representations learned

                   methods for the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. The
                   major incentives for incorporating Bayesian reasoning in RL
                   are: 1) it provides an elegant approach to action-selection

                   higher-order combinators to compose a library of neural

              or she can effortlessly understand how to ``dax twice,'' ``walk
              and dax,'' or ``dax vigorously.'' There have been striking recent
              improvements in machine learning for natural language processing,
              yet the best algorithms require vast amounts of experience and
              struggle to generalize new concepts in compositional ways. To
              better understand these distinctively human abilities, we study
              the compositional skills of people through languagelike
              instruction learning tasks. Our results show that people can
              learn and use novel functional concepts from very few examples
              (few-shot learning), successfully applying familiar functions to
              novel inputs. People can also compose concepts in complex ways
              that go beyond the provided demonstrations. Two additional
              experiments examined the assumptions and inductive biases that
              people make when solving these tasks, revealing three biases:
              mutual exclusivity, one-to-one mappings, and iconic
              concatenation. We discuss the implications for cognitive modeling

              representation and translates sentences into executable, symbolic

  abstract      = "To make deliberate progress towards more intelligent and
                   more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following
                   an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define
                   and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons
                   between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans.
                   Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of
                   attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the
                   fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically
                   assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while
                   making apparent the two historical conceptions of
                   intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that
                   in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates
                   towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill
                   exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks, such as board
                   games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill
                   at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence,
                   because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and
                   experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data
                   allow experimenters to ``buy'' arbitrary levels of skills
                   for a system, in a way that masks the system's own
                   generalization power. We then articulate a new formal
                   definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information
                   Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition
                   efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope,
                   generalization difficulty, priors, and experience, as
                   critical pieces to be accounted for in characterizing
                   intelligent systems. Using this definition, we propose a set
                   of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look
                   like. Finally, we present a new benchmark closely following
                   these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus
                   (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be
                   as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that
                   ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general
                   fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general

                   models without requiring more labeled data. While effective,
                   feature extractors like BERT may be prohibitively large for
                   some deployment scenarios. We explore weight pruning for
                   BERT and ask: how does compression during pre-training
                   affect transfer learning? We find that pruning affects
                   transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of
                   pruning (30-40\%) do not affect pre-training loss or
                   transfer to downstream tasks at all. Medium levels of
                   pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful
                   pre-training information from being transferred to
                   downstream tasks. High levels of pruning additionally

                   approach to evaluate generalization, it often overestimates
                   the performance of NLP models, while alternative approaches
                   for evaluating models either focus on individual tasks or on
                   specific behaviors. Inspired by principles of behavioral
                   testing in software engineering, we introduce CheckList, a
                   task-agnostic methodology for testing NLP models. CheckList
                   includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and

                   tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of
                   text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While
                   typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still
                   requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or
                   tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can
                   generally perform a new language task from only a few
                   examples or from simple instructions - something which
                   current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we
                   show that scaling up language models greatly improves
                   task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching
                   competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
                   approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive
                   language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than
                   any previous non-sparse language model, and test its
                   performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
                   applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with
                   tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text
                   interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong
                   performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
                   question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several
                   tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain
                   adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word
                   in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same
                   time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot
                   learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where
                   GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on
                   large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate

                   difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

              approaches fall well short of these human standards, although
              different modeling traditions often have complementary strengths.
              Symbolic models can capture the compositional and causal
              knowledge that enables flexible generalization, but they struggle
              to learn from raw inputs, relying on strong abstractions and
              simplifying assumptions. Neural network models can learn directly
              from raw data, but they struggle to capture compositional and
              causal structure and typically must retrain to tackle new tasks.
              We bring together these two traditions to learn generative models
              of concepts that capture rich compositional and causal structure,
              while learning from raw data. We develop a generative
              neuro-symbolic (GNS) model of handwritten character concepts that
              uses the control flow of a probabilistic program, coupled with
              symbolic stroke primitives and a symbolic image renderer, to
              represent the causal and compositional processes by which
              characters are formed. The distributions of parts (strokes), and
              correlations between parts, are modeled with neural network
              subroutines, allowing the model to learn directly from raw data
              and express nonparametric statistical relationships. We apply our
              model to the Omniglot challenge of human-level concept learning,
              using a background set of alphabets to learn an expressive prior
              distribution over character drawings. In a subsequent evaluation,
              our GNS model uses probabilistic inference to learn rich
              conceptual representations from a single training image that

                   available to them? This process must involve some inductive
                   biases - factors that affect how a learner generalizes - but
                   it is unclear which inductive biases can explain observed
                   patterns in language acquisition. To facilitate
                   computational modeling aimed at addressing this question, we
                   introduce a framework for giving particular linguistic
                   inductive biases to a neural network model; such a model can
                   then be used to empirically explore the effects of those
                   inductive biases. This framework disentangles universal
                   inductive biases, which are encoded in the initial values of
                   a neural network's parameters, from non-universal factors,
                   which the neural network must learn from data in a given
                   language. The initial state that encodes the inductive
                   biases is found with meta-learning, a technique through
                   which a model discovers how to acquire new languages more
                   easily via exposure to many possible languages. By
                   controlling the properties of the languages that are used
                   during meta-learning, we can control the inductive biases
                   that meta-learning imparts. We demonstrate this framework
                   with a case study based on syllable structure. First, we
                   specify the inductive biases that we intend to give our
                   model, and then we translate those inductive biases into a
                   space of languages from which a model can meta-learn.
                   Finally, using existing analysis techniques, we verify that
                   our approach has imparted the linguistic inductive biases

                   this remarkable performance is because the meta-training

                   intelligence could be explained by a few principles (rather
                   than an encyclopedic list of heuristics). If that hypothesis
                   was correct, we could more easily both understand our own
                   intelligence and build intelligent machines. Just like in
                   physics, the principles themselves would not be sufficient
                   to predict the behavior of complex systems like brains, and
                   substantial computation might be needed to simulate
                   human-like intelligence. This hypothesis would suggest that
                   studying the kind of inductive biases that humans and
                   animals exploit could help both clarify these principles and
                   provide inspiration for AI research and neuroscience
                   theories. Deep learning already exploits several key
                   inductive biases, and this work considers a larger list,
                   focusing on those which concern mostly higher-level and

              generalization, which extends far beyond our direct experiences.
              In this paper, we argue that the underlying cause for this
              shortcoming is their inability to dynamically and flexibly bind
              information that is distributed throughout the network. This
              binding problem affects their capacity to acquire a compositional
              understanding of the world in terms of symbol-like entities (like
              objects), which is crucial for generalizing in predictable and
              systematic ways. To address this issue, we propose a unifying
              framework that revolves around forming meaningful entities from
              unstructured sensory inputs (segregation), maintaining this
              separation of information at a representational level
              (representation), and using these entities to construct new
              inferences, predictions, and behaviors (composition). Our
              analysis draws inspiration from a wealth of research in
              neuroscience and cognitive psychology, and surveys relevant
              mechanisms from the machine learning literature, to help identify
              a combination of inductive biases that allow symbolic information
              processing to emerge naturally in neural networks. We believe
              that a compositional approach to AI, in terms of grounded
              symbol-like representations, is of fundamental importance for
              realizing human-level generalization, and we hope that this paper
              may contribute towards that goal as a reference and inspiration.",

              additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual

              promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of
              supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of
              predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient
              and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch
              on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from
              the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to
              reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling
              zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the
              performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different

                   they interact with one another. To partition images into
                   entities, deep-learning researchers have proposed structural
                   inductive biases such as slot-based architectures. To model
                   interactions among entities, equivariant graph neural nets
                   (GNNs) are used, but these are not particularly well suited
                   to the task for two reasons. First, GNNs do not predispose
                   interactions to be sparse, as relationships among
                   independent entities are likely to be. Second, GNNs do not
                   factorize knowledge about interactions in an
                   entity-conditional manner. As an alternative, we take
                   inspiration from cognitive science and resurrect a classic
                   approach, production systems, which consist of a set of rule
                   templates that are applied by binding placeholder variables
                   in the rules to specific entities. Rules are scored on their
                   match to entities, and the best fitting rules are applied to
                   update entity properties. In a series of experiments, we

                   the \textbackslashtextit\{Language-complete ARC\}: a
                   collection of natural language descriptions by a group of
                   human participants who instruct each other on how to solve
                   ARC tasks using language alone, which contains successful
                   instructions for 88\% of the ARC tasks. We analyze the
                   collected instructions as `natural programs', finding that
                   while they resemble computer programs, they are distinct in
                   two ways: First, they contain a wide range of primitives;
                   Second, they frequently leverage communicative strategies
                   beyond directly executable codes. We demonstrate that these
                   two distinctions prevent current program synthesis
                   techniques from leveraging LARC to its full potential, and
                   give concrete suggestions on how to build the

  abstract      = "Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with
                   surging interest in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in
                   this domain heavily relies on faithful representation of the
                   sparsity of subnetworks, which has been traditionally
                   computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct
                   sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize
                   unpruned parameters that detached from input or output
                   layers of underlying subnetworks, potentially
                   underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of
                   inactivated connections. While this effect might be
                   negligible for moderately pruned networks (up to 10-100
                   compression rates), we find that it plays an increasing role
                   for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison
                   between different pruning algorithms. For example, we show
                   that effective compression of a randomly pruned
                   LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its
                   direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed
                   when using SynFlow for pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In
                   this work, we adopt the lens of effective sparsity to
                   reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common
                   benchmark architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19,
                   ResNet-18) and discover that their absolute and relative
                   performance changes dramatically in this new and more
                   appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than
                   direct, sparsity, we develop a low-cost extension to most
                   pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with effective
                   sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that
                   random pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across
                   layers performs as well or better than more sophisticated
                   algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et al., 2020].
                   In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of
                   pressure distribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we
                   design novel layerwise sparsity quotas that outperform all

                   constructing an open-ended learning process, which

                   Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) is a promising
                   self-supervised RL paradigm, wherein the free parameters of
                   an underspecified environment are automatically adapted
                   during training to the agent's capabilities, leading to the
                   emergence of diverse training environments. Here, we cast
                   Prioritized Level Replay (PLR), an empirically successful
                   but theoretically unmotivated method that selectively
                   samples randomly-generated training levels, as UED. We argue
                   that by curating completely random levels, PLR, too, can
                   generate novel and complex levels for effective training.
                   This insight reveals a natural class of UED methods we call
                   Dual Curriculum Design (DCD). Crucially, DCD includes both
                   PLR and a popular UED algorithm, PAIRED, as special cases
                   and inherits similar theoretical guarantees. This connection
                   allows us to develop novel theory for PLR, providing a
                   version with a robustness guarantee at Nash equilibria.
                   Furthermore, our theory suggests a highly counterintuitive
                   improvement to PLR: by stopping the agent from updating its
                   policy on uncurated levels (training on less data), we can
                   improve the convergence to Nash equilibria. Indeed, our
                   experiments confirm that our new method, PLR$^\{\perp\}$,
                   obtains better results on a suite of out-of-distribution,
                   zero-shot transfer tasks, in addition to demonstrating that

                   how the compressed sparse pre-trained models we trained
                   transfer their knowledge to five different downstream
                   natural language tasks with minimal accuracy loss. Moreover,
                   we show how to further compress the sparse models' weights
                   to 8bit precision using quantization-aware training. For
                   example, with our sparse pre-trained BERT-Large fine-tuned
                   on SQuADv1.1 and quantized to 8bit we achieve a compression
                   ratio of $40$X for the encoder with less than $1\%$ accuracy
                   loss. To the best of our knowledge, our results show the
                   best compression-to-accuracy ratio for BERT-Base,
                   BERT-Large, and DistilBERT.",

              have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a

              drastically reduces the number of task-speciﬁc training examples
              needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further
              our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we
              trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer
              language model, which we call Pathways Language Model (PaLM). We
              trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system
              which enables highly eﬃcient training across multiple TPU Pods.
              We demonstrate continued beneﬁts of scaling by achieving
              state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of
              language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of
              these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance,

              capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation,

              respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical

                   toddlers, demonstrate learning and thinking in a strikingly
                   similar manner to scientific reasoning in formal research.
                   Encountering a novel phenomenon, children make hypotheses
                   against data, conduct causal inference from observation,
                   test their theory via experimentation, and correct the
                   proposition if inconsistency arises. Rounds of such
                   processes continue until the underlying mechanism is found.
                   Towards building machines that can learn and think like
                   people, one natural question for us to ask is: whether the
                   intelligence we achieve today manages to perform such a
                   scientific thinking process, and if any, at what level. In
                   this work, we devise the EST environment for evaluating the
                   scientific thinking ability in artificial agents. Motivated
                   by the stream of research on causal discovery, we build our
                   interactive EST environment based on Blicket detection.
                   Specifically, in each episode of EST, an agent is presented
                   with novel observations and asked to figure out all objects'
                   Blicketness. At each time step, the agent proposes new
                   experiments to validate its hypothesis and updates its
                   current belief. By evaluating Reinforcement Learning (RL)
                   agents on both a symbolic and visual version of this task,
                   we notice clear failure of today's learning methods in
                   reaching a level of intelligence comparable to humans. Such
                   inefficacy of learning in scientific thinking calls for

                   understand concepts in a humanlike way. Setting aside the
                   difficulty of building such a system, even trying to
                   evaluate one is a challenge, due to present-day AI's
                   relative opacity and its proclivity for finding shortcut
                   solutions. This is exacerbated by humans' tendency to
                   anthropomorphize, assuming that a system that can recognize
                   one instance of a concept must also understand other
                   instances, as a human would. In this paper, we argue that
                   understanding a concept requires the ability to use it in
                   varied contexts. Accordingly, we propose systematic
                   evaluations centered around concepts, by probing a system's

                   interaction for robots. These embodied problems require an
                   agent to understand many semantic aspects of the world: the
                   repertoire of skills available, how these skills influence
                   the world, and how changes to the world map back to the
                   language. LLMs planning in embodied environments need to
                   consider not just what skills to do, but also how and when
                   to do them - answers that change over time in response to
                   the agent's own choices. In this work, we investigate to

                   imperfect, and depends on our knowledge and beliefs about
                   the content of the reasoning problem. For example, humans
                   reason much more reliably about logical rules that are
                   grounded in everyday situations than arbitrary rules about
                   abstract attributes. The training experiences of language

                   sentences can be extracted from an ideal language model that
                   has perfectly learned its target distribution, assuming the
                   training sentences are generated by Gricean agents, i.e.,
                   agents who follow fundamental principles of communication
                   from the linguistic theory of pragmatics. We also show
                   entailment judgments can be decoded from the predictions of
                   a language model trained on such Gricean data. Our results

                   represent the physical, non-linguistic world is an open
                   question. Prior work has shown that pretrained LMs can be
                   taught to ``understand'' visual inputs when the models'
                   parameters are updated on image captioning tasks. We test a
                   stronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations
                   learned by text-only models are functionally equivalent (up
                   to a linear transformation) to those learned by models
                   trained on vision tasks. Specifically, we show that the
                   image representations from vision models can be transferred
                   as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only a
                   single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM
                   achieves competitive performance on captioning and visual
                   question answering tasks compared to models that tune both
                   the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA

                   amounts of linguistic supervision seen during pretraining:
                   BEIT (no linguistic information), NF-ResNET (lexical
                   category information), and CLIP (full natural language

                   equally well at transferring visual property information to
                   the language model (e.g., whether an animal is large or
                   small), but that image encoders pretrained with linguistic
                   supervision more saliently encode category information
                   (e.g., distinguishing hippo vs.\textbackslash elephant) and
                   thus perform significantly better on benchmark
                   language-and-vision tasks. Our results indicate that LMs

                   preferred alternative. Surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy,
                   2008), a prominent explanation of this finding, proposes
                   that these slowdowns are due to the unpredictability of each
                   of the words that occur in these sentences. Challenging this

                   this underestimation is due to the fact that humans weight
                   syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than

                   underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects.
                   Our results support the hypothesis that predictability is

                   recursively nested grammatical structures. Prior work has
                   suggested that language models cannot handle these
                   structures as reliably as humans can. However, the humans
                   were provided with instructions and training before being
                   evaluated, while the language models were evaluated
                   zero-shot. I therefore attempt to more closely match the
                   evaluation paradigms by providing language models with
                   few-shot prompts. A simple prompt, which contains
                   substantially less content than the human training, allows
                   large language models to consistently outperform the human
                   results. The same prompt even allows extrapolation to more
                   deeply nested conditions than have been tested in humans.
                   Further, a reanalysis of the prior human experiments
                   suggests that the humans may not perform above chance at the
                   difficult structures initially. These results suggest that
                   large language models can in fact process recursively nested
                   grammatical structures comparably to humans. This case study
                   highlights how discrepancies in the quantity of
                   experiment-specific context can confound comparisons of
                   language models and humans. I use this case study to reflect

                   capabilities, and to suggest that there is an important

                   problems, but so far these successes have not fully
                   translated to reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we
                   demonstrate that training an RL agent at scale leads to a
                   general in-context learning algorithm that can adapt to
                   open-ended novel embodied 3D problems as quickly as humans.
                   In a vast space of held-out environment dynamics, our
                   adaptive agent (AdA) displays on-the-fly hypothesis-driven
                   exploration, efficient exploitation of acquired knowledge,
                   and can successfully be prompted with first-person
                   demonstrations. Adaptation emerges from three ingredients:
                   (1) meta-reinforcement learning across a vast, smooth and
                   diverse task distribution, (2) a policy parameterised as a
                   large-scale attention-based memory architecture, and (3) an
                   effective automated curriculum that prioritises tasks at the
                   frontier of an agent's capabilities. We demonstrate
                   characteristic scaling laws with respect to network size,
                   memory length, and richness of the training task
                   distribution. We believe our results lay the foundation for
                   increasingly general and adaptive RL agents that perform

                   complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists
                   in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs
                   can leverage these augmentations separately or in
                   combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from
                   demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens

                   Such insight-related performance improvements appear special
                   because they are preceded by an extended period of impasse,
                   are unusually abrupt, and occur only in some, but not all,
                   learners. Here, we ask whether insight-like behaviour also
                   occurs in artificial neural networks trained with gradient
                   descent algorithms. We compared learning dynamics in humans
                   and regularised neural networks in a perceptual decision
                   task that provided a hidden opportunity which allowed to
                   solve the task more efficiently. We show that humans tend to
                   discover this regularity through insight, rather than
                   gradually. Notably, neural networks with regularised gate
                   modulation closely mimicked behavioural characteristics of
                   human insights, exhibiting delay of insight, suddenness and

                   revealed that insight-like behaviour crucially depended on
                   noise added to gradient updates, and was preceded by
                   ``silent knowledge'' that is initially suppressed by
                   regularised (attentional) gating. This suggests that
                   insights can arise naturally from gradual learning, where

                   generative agents produce believable individual and emergent
                   social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single
                   user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a
                   Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread
                   invitations to the party over the next two days, make new
                   acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and
                   coordinate to show up for the party together at the right
                   time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of
                   our agent architecture--observation, planning, and
                   reflection--each contribute critically to the believability
                   of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with
                   computational, interactive agents, this work introduces
                   architectural and interaction patterns for enabling

                   despite that fact that we get no additional data from the
                   world. Similarly, large language models can perform better
                   at complex tasks through chain-of-thought reasoning, where
                   they generate intermediate steps before answering a
                   question. We use language models to investigate the
                   questions of when and why reasoning is helpful, testing the
                   hypothesis that reasoning is effective when training data
                   consisting of local clusters of variables that influence
                   each other strongly. These training conditions enable the
                   chaining of accurate local inferences in order to estimate
                   relationships between variables that were not seen together

                   samples from joint distributions defined by Bayes nets, but
                   only include a subset of all the variables in each sample.

                   performance on code generation. However, for complex
                   programming tasks, generating the correct solution in one go
                   becomes challenging, thus some prior works have designed
                   program repair approaches to improve code generation
                   performance. In this work, we propose Self-Debugging, which
                   teaches a large language model to debug its predicted
                   program via few-shot demonstrations. In particular, we
                   demonstrate that Self-Debugging can teach the large language
                   model to perform rubber duck debugging; i.e., without any
                   feedback on the code correctness or error messages, the
                   model is able to identify its mistakes by explaining the
                   generated code in natural language. Self-Debugging achieves
                   the state-of-the-art performance on several code generation
                   benchmarks, including the Spider dataset for text-to-SQL
                   generation, TransCoder for C++-to-Python translation, and
                   MBPP for text-to-Python generation. On the Spider benchmark
                   where there are no unit tests to verify the correctness of
                   predictions, Self-Debugging with code explanation
                   consistently improves the baseline by 2-3\%, and improves
                   the prediction accuracy on problems of the hardest label by
                   9\%. On TransCoder and MBPP where unit tests are available,
                   Self-Debugging improves the baseline accuracy by up to 12\%.
                   Meanwhile, by leveraging feedback messages and reusing
                   failed predictions, Self-Debugging notably improves sample
                   efficiency, and can match or outperform baseline models that

                   idealized domains such as Raven's Progressive Matrices and

                   benchmark for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a
                   collection of few-shot abstraction and analogy problems

                   generalization abilities on a number of basic spatial and
                   semantic concepts. ConceptARC differs from the original ARC
                   dataset in that it is specifically organized around
                   ``concept groups'' -- sets of problems that focus on

              been influenced by a range of direct and indirect selection
              pressures for both cognitive and non-cognitive functions and
              capabilities. It has been hypothesized that hominin brain
              expansion was, in part, a correlated response to selection acting
              on aerobic capacity (Raichlen \& Polk, 2013). According to this
              hypothesis, selection for aerobic capacity increased the activity
              of various signaling molecules, including those involved in brain
              growth. One key molecule is brain-derived neurotrophic factor
              (BDNF), a protein that regulates neuronal development, survival,
              and plasticity in mammals. This review updates, partially tests,
              and expands Raichlen and Polk's (2013) hypothesis by evaluating
              evidence for BDNF as a mediator of brain size. Discussion We
              contend that selection for endurance capabilities in a hot
              climate favored changes to muscle composition, mitochondrial
              dynamics and increased energy budget through pathways involving
              regulation of PGC-1$\alpha$ and MEF2 genes, both of which promote
              BDNF activity. In addition, the evolution of hairlessness and the
              skin's thermoregulatory response provide other molecular pathways
              that promote both BDNF activity and neurotransmitter synthesis.
              We discuss how these pathways contributed to the evolution of

              contribution of two separable memory retrieval processes, namely
              recollection and familiarity. However, fundamental questions
              remain regarding the functional nature and neural substrates of
              these processes. In this article, we describe a simple
              quantitative model of recognition memory (i.e., the dual-process
              signal detection model) that has been useful in integrating
              findings from a broad range of cognitive studies, and that is now
              being applied in a growing number of neuroscientific
              investigations of memory. The model makes several strong
              assumptions about the behavioral nature and neural substrates of
              recollection and familiarity. A review of the literature
              indicates that these assumptions are generally well supported,

              important insights into the operation of the processes underlying

  title    = "A Distributed Representation of Temporal Context",
  author   = "Howard, Marc W and Kahana, Michael J",
  abstract = "The principles of recency and contiguity are two cornerstones of
              the theoretical and empirical analysis of human memory. Recency
              has been alternatively explained by mechanisms of decay,
              displacement, and retroactive interference. Another account of
              recency is based on the idea of variable context (Estes, 1955;
              Mensink \& Raaijmakers, 1989). Such notions are typically cast in
              terms of a randomly fluctuating population of elements reflective
              of subtle changes in the environment or in the subjects' mental
              state. This random context view has recently been incorporated
              into distributed and neural network memory models (Murdock, 1997;
              Murdock, Smith, \& Bai, 2001). Here we propose an alternative
              model. Rather than being driven by random fluctuations, this
              formulation, the temporal context model (TCM), uses retrieval of
              prior contextual states to drive contextual drift. In TCM,
              retrieved context is an inherently asymmetric retrieval cue. This
              allows the model to provide a principled explanation of the
              widespread advantage for forward recalls in free and serial
              recall. Modeling data from single-trial free recall, we
              demonstrate that TCM can simultaneously explain recency and
              contiguity effects across time scales.",

               experience with an incompletely known system to predict its
               future behavior. Whereas conventional prediction-learning
               methods assign credit by means of the difference between
               predicted and actual outcomes, the new methods assign credit by
               means of the difference between temporally successive
               predictions. Although such temporal-difference methods have been
               used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and
               the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained

               less peak computation than conventional methods and they produce
               more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which

              insight into how the mind works. However, these insights often
              seem incompatible, as the debates between symbolic, dynamical,
              emergentist, sub-symbolic, and grounded approaches to cognition
              attest. Mental representations---whatever they are---must share
              many features with each of our theories of representation, and
              yet there are few hypotheses about how a synthesis could be
              possible. Here, I develop a theory of the underpinnings of
              symbolic cognition that shows how sub-symbolic dynamics may give
              rise to higher-level cognitive representations of structures,
              systems of knowledge, and algorithmic processes. This theory
              implements a version of conceptual role semantics by positing an
              internal universal representation language in which learners may
              create mental models to capture dynamics they observe in the
              world. The theory formalizes one account of how truly novel
              conceptual content may arise, allowing us to explain how even
              elementary logical and computational operations may be learned
              from a more primitive basis. I provide an implementation that
              learns to represent a variety of structures, including logic,
              number, kinship trees, regular languages, context-free languages,
              domains of theories like magnetism, dominance hierarchies, list
              structures, quantification, and computational primitives like
              repetition, reversal, and recursion. This account is based on
              simple discrete dynamical processes that could be implemented in
              a variety of different physical or biological systems. In
              particular, I describe how the required dynamics can be directly
              implemented in a connectionist framework. The resulting theory
              provides an ``assembly language'' for cognition, where high-level
              theories of symbolic computation can be implemented in simple
              dynamics that themselves could be encoded in biologically

              Conaway and Kurtz (Conaway and Kurtz, Psychonomic Bulletin \&
              Review 24:1312--1323, 2017) reported results from a novel
              paradigm in which participants learned rule-described categories
              defined over two dimensions and then classified test items in
              distant transfer regions of the category space. The paradigm
              yielded results that challenged the predictions from both
              exemplar-based and logical-rule-based models of categorization
              but that the authors suggested were as predicted by a divergent
              auto-encoder (DIVA) model (Kurtz, Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review

              Academic Press, New York, 2015). In this article, we pursue these
              challenges by conducting replications and extensions of the
              original experiment and fitting a variety of computational models
              to the resulting data. We find that even an extended version of
              the exemplar model that makes allowance for learning-during-test
              (LDT) processes fails to account for the results. In addition,
              models that presume a mixture of salient logical rules also fail
              to account for the findings. However, as a proof of concept, we
              illustrate that a model that assumes a mixture of strategies
              across subjects---some relying on exemplar-based memories with
              LDT, and others on salient logical rules---provides an
              outstanding account of the data. By comparison, DIVA performs
              considerably worse than does this LDT-exemplar-rule mixture
              account. These results converge with past ones reported in the

              i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit
              certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given
              thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with
              semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make
              a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist
              at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that
              Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or `abstract
              neurological') structures in which Classical cognitive
              architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard
              arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and
              conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation.
              R{\'e}sum{\'e} Cet article{\'e}tudie les diff{\'e}rences entre
              mod{\`e}les connectionistes et mod{\`e}les classiques de la

              mod{\`e}les stipulent l'existence d'{\'e}tats mentaux
              repr{\'e}sentationnels, la diff{\'e}rence essentielle est que

              niveau de repr{\'e}sentation symbolique---un ``langage de la

              repr{\'e}sentationnels poss{\'e}dant une structure syntaxique et
              s{\'e}mantique. Nous examinons ensuite diff{\'e}rents arguments
              qui militent en faveur de l'existence de repr{\'e}sentations
              mentales ayant ces propri{\'e}t{\'e}s. Certains de ces arguments
              reposent sur la ``syst{\'e}maticit{\'e}'' des repr{\'e}sentations
              mentales, c'est-{\`a}-dire sur le fait que les capacit{\'e}s
              cognitives exhibent toujours certaines sym{\'e}tries, de sorte
              que la capacit{\'e}d'entretenir certaines pens{\'e}es implique la
              capacit{\'e}d'entretenir d'autres pens{\'e}es apparent{\'e}es par
              leur contenu s{\'e}mantique. Nous pensons que ces arguments
              montrent de mani{\`e}re convainquante que l'architecture de
              l'esprit/du cerveau n'est pas connectioniste au niveau cognitif.
              Nous nous demandons ensuite s'il est possible d'interpr{\'e}ter
              le connectionisme comme une analyse des structures neuronales (ou
              des structures neurologiques ``abstraites'') dans lesquelles est
              r{\'e}alis{\'e}e l'architecture cognitive classique. Nous
              examinons plusieurs des arguments avanc{\'e}s habituellement en
              d{\'e}fense du connectionisme, et en concluons que ceux-ci n'ont
              de sens que dans cette interpr{\'e}tation.",

              requires discovering an effective problem representation, and
              that performance on insight problems can be predicted from the
              availability of generators and constraints in the search for such
              a representation. To test these claims we varied the salience of
              features leading to the critical concept of parity in the MC
              problem. Using chronometric measures, verbal protocols, and
              computer simulations, we explored first why it is difficult to
              find a representation for the Checkerboard problem, and then
              tested four potential sources of search constraint for reducing
              the difficulty: cue salience manipulations, prior knowledge,
              hints, and heuristics. While subjects used each of these four

              be a particularly powerful means for focusing search. In

               the quantitative knowledge used by engineers and scientists. The
               key to qualitative physics is to find ways to represent
               continuous properties of the world by discrete systems of
               symbols. One can always quantize something continuous, but not
               all quantizations are equally useful. One way to state the idea
               is the relevance principle: The distinctions made by a
               quantization must be relevant to the kind of reasoning
               performed. This chapter describes what qualitative physics is,

              (total n = 510) to demonstrate that humans exploit an interactive

              affects exploration and discovery. In Experiment 1, we
              investigated children's exploratory play after an adult
              pedagogically demonstrated a function of a toy, after an
              interrupted pedagogical demonstration, after a na{\"\i}ve adult
              demonstrated the function, and at baseline. Preschoolers in the
              pedagogical condition focused almost exclusively on the target
              function; by contrast, children in the other conditions explored
              broadly. In Experiment 2, we show that children restrict their
              exploration both after direct instruction to themselves and after
              overhearing direct instruction given to another child; they do
              not show this constraint after observing direct instruction given
              to an adult or after observing a non-pedagogical intentional
              action. We discuss these findings as the result of rational
              inductive biases. In pedagogical contexts, a teacher's failure to
              provide evidence for additional functions provides evidence for
              their absence; such contexts generalize from child to child
              (because children are likely to have comparable states of
              knowledge) but not from adult to child. Thus, pedagogy promotes

              modern artificial neural network trained with ``deep learning''
              methods mimics a central aspect of human sentence processing,
              namely the storing of grammatical number and gender information
              in working memory and its use in long-distance agreement (e.g.,
              capturing the correct number agreement between subject and verb
              when they are separated by other phrases). Although the network,
              a recurrent architecture with Long Short-Term Memory units, was
              solely trained to predict the next word in a large corpus,
              analysis showed the emergence of a very sparse set of specialized
              units that successfully handled local and long-distance syntactic
              agreement for grammatical number. However, the simulations also
              showed that this mechanism does not support full recursion and
              fails with some long-range embedded dependencies. We tested the
              model's predictions in a behavioral experiment where humans
              detected violations in number agreement in sentences with
              systematic variations in the singular/plural status of multiple

              were remarkably similar, showing that the model echoes various

              that, with embedded long-range dependencies, humans remained
              above chance level, while the model's systematic errors brought
              it below chance. Overall, our study shows that exploring the ways

              (N=416) asks when language might outperform demonstration. We

              We hypothesized that language allowed teachers to reference

              demonstration teachers could only provide concrete examples

              that language communicates complex concepts by directly

              ``experiment'' within the physical world to discover such latent
              properties. In the first part of the paper, we develop a novel
              framework for the quantitative analysis of the information
              produced by physical interactions. We then describe two
              experiments that present participants with moving objects in
              ``microworlds'' that operate according to continuous
              spatiotemporal dynamics similar to everyday physics (i.e., forces
              of gravity, friction, etc.). Participants were asked to interact
              with objects in the microworlds in order to identify their
              masses, or the forces of attraction/repulsion that governed their
              movement. Using our modeling framework, we find that learners who
              freely interacted with the physical system selectively produced
              evidence that revealed the physical property consistent with
              their inquiry goal. As a result, their inferences were more

              interacts with many other cognitive processes such as

              analysis, and synthesis on the basis of internal knowledge
              representation by the object--attribute-relation (OAR) model.
              Problem solving is a cognitive process of the brain that searches
              a solution for a given problem or finds a path to reach a given
              goal. When a problem object is identified, problem solving can be
              perceived as a search process in the memory space for finding a
              relationship between a set of solution goals and a set of
              alternative paths. This paper presents both a cognitive model and
              a mathematical model of the problem solving process. The

              We suggest that, in a statistical account of conditioning,
              surprise signals change and therefore uncertainty and the need
              for new learning. We discuss inference in a world that changes

              higher-cognitive functions, including language and mathematics,
              becoming sensitive to the grammatical structure of spoken
              sentences and the difficulty of math equations. Visual cortex
              activity at rest becomes synchronized with higher-cognitive

              and evolutionary differences between vision, language, and

  abstract = "The dominant paradigm of experiments in the social and behavioral
              sciences views an experiment as a test of a theory, where the
              theory is assumed to generalize beyond the experiment's specific
              conditions. According to this view, which Alan Newell once
              characterized as ``playing twenty questions with nature,'' theory
              is advanced one experiment at a time, and the integration of
              disparate findings is assumed to happen via the scientific
              publishing process. In this article, we argue that the process of
              integration is at best inefficient, and at worst it does not, in
              fact, occur. We further show that the challenge of integration
              cannot be adequately addressed by recently proposed reforms that
              focus on the reliability and replicability of individual
              findings, nor simply by conducting more or larger experiments.
              Rather, the problem arises from the imprecise nature of social
              and behavioral theories and, consequently, a lack of
              commensurability across experiments conducted under different
              conditions. Therefore, researchers must fundamentally rethink how
              they design experiments and how the experiments relate to theory.
              We specifically describe an alternative framework, integrative
              experiment design, which intrinsically promotes commensurability
              and continuous integration of knowledge. In this paradigm,
              researchers explicitly map the design space of possible
              experiments associated with a given research question, embracing
              many potentially relevant theories rather than focusing on just
              one. The researchers then iteratively generate theories and test
              them with experiments explicitly sampled from the design space,
              allowing results to be integrated across experiments. Given
              recent methodological and technological developments, we conclude
              that this approach is feasible and would generate more-reliable,

  abstract = "Mental set is the tendency to solve certain problems in a fixed
              way based on previous solutions to similar problems. The moment
              of insight occurs when a problem cannot be solved using solution
              methods suggested by prior experience and the problem solver
              suddenly realizes that the solution requires different solution
              methods. Mental set and insight have often been linked together
              and yet no attempt thus far has systematically examined the
              interplay between the two. Three experiments are presented that
              examine the extent to which sets of noninsight and insight
              problems affect the subsequent solutions of insight test
              problems. The results indicate a subtle interplay between mental
              set and insight: when the set involves noninsight problems, no
              mental set effects are shown for the insight test problems, yet

              have been proposed to explain insight. The representational
              change theory (e.g., G. Knoblich, S. Ohlsson, \& G. E. Rainey,
              2001) proposes that insight occurs through relaxing self-imposed
              constraints on a problem and by decomposing chunked items in the
              problem. The progress monitoring theory (e.g., J. N. MacGregor,

              only sought once it becomes apparent that the distance to the
              goal is unachievable in the moves remaining. These 2 theories are
              tested in an unlimited move problem, to which neither theory has
              previously been applied. The results lend support to both, but

              representational change theory is the better indicator of

              the necessity to overcome the constraint that a solution can be

  abstract = "Representations are a key explanatory device used by cognitive
              psychologists to account for human behavior. Understanding the
              effects of context and experience on the representations people
              use is essential, because if two people encode the same stimulus
              using different representations, their response to that stimulus
              may be different. We present a computational framework that can
              be used to define models that flexibly construct feature
              representations (where by a feature we mean a part of the image
              of an object) for a set of observed objects, based on
              nonparametric Bayesian statistics. Austerweil and Griffiths
              (2011) presented an initial model constructed in this framework
              that captures how the distribution of parts affects the features
              people use to represent a set of objects. We build on this work
              in three ways. First, although people use features that can be
              transformed on each observation (e.g., translate on the retinal
              image), many existing feature learning models can only recognize
              features that are not transformed (occur identically each time).
              Consequently, we extend the initial model to infer features that
              are invariant over a set of transformations, and learn different
              structures of dependence between feature transformations. Second,
              we compare two possible methods for capturing the manner that
              categorization affects feature representations. Finally, we
              present a model that learns features incrementally, capturing an
              effect of the order of object presentation on the features people
              learn. We conclude by considering the implications and
              limitations of our empirical and theoretical results.",

               that prevent us from accurately understanding our world? In this
               article we investigate the concept of a ``learning trap''---the

               experience. Our review highlights how these traps develop

              is a simple explicit rule, whereas in information-integration

              verbally. This study investigates the effects of two different
              category properties on learning difficulty in category learning
              tasks-namely, linear separability and variability on stimulus
              dimensions that are irrelevant to the categorization decision.
              Previous research had reported that linearly separable II
              categories are easier to learn than nonlinearly separable
              categories, but Experiment 1, which compared performance on
              linearly and nonlinearly separable categories that were equated
              as closely as possible on all other factors that might affect
              difficulty, found that linear separability had no effect on
              learning. Experiments 1 and 2 together also established a novel
              dissociation between RB and II category learning: increasing
              variability on irrelevant stimulus dimensions impaired II
              learning but not RB learning. These results are all predicted by

  abstract = "Decision making in an uncertain environment poses a conflict
              between the opposing demands of gathering and exploiting
              information. In a classic illustration of this
              'exploration-exploitation' dilemma, a gambler choosing between
              multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems,
              on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option,
              against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might
              turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide information for
              improving future decisions). Far from representing idle
              curiosity, such exploration is often critical for organisms to
              discover how best to harvest resources such as food and water. In
              appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned
              by computational reinforcement learning (RL) theory, indicates
              that a dopaminergic, striatal and medial prefrontal network
              mediates learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration
              has been well studied from both theoretical and ethological
              perspectives, its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we
              show, in a gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be
              characterized by a computationally well-regarded strategy for
              addressing the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this
              characterization to classify decisions as exploratory or
              exploitative, we employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to
              show that the frontopolar cortex and intraparietal sulcus are
              preferentially active during exploratory decisions. In contrast,
              regions of striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit
              activity characteristic of an involvement in value-based
              exploitative decision making. The results suggest a model of
              action selection under uncertainty that involves switching
              between exploratory and exploitative behavioural modes, and
              provide a computationally precise characterization of the

              study the cellular and network basis of defined
              operations---operations that include cognitive processes that
              have been otherwise difficult to study (see Box 1 for useful

              representation of complex memories, the role of mental
              exploration based on imagined rather than real movements, and the
              use of recalled information for navigation and decision-making.
              The progress that has been made in understanding the hippocampus
              has motivated the study of other brain regions that provide
              hippocampal input or receive hippocampal output; the hippocampus

              more easily reason about them. We propose a computational account
              of this simplification process and, in a series of preregistered
              behavioural experiments, show that it is subject to online
              cognitive control12-14 and that people optimally balance the
              complexity of a task representation and its utility for planning
              and acting. These results demonstrate how strategically

              still debated whether skilled decision-makers plan more steps
              ahead than novices6-8. Traditionally, the study of expertise in
              planning has used board games such as chess, but the complexity
              of these games poses a barrier to quantitative estimates of
              planning depth. Conversely, common planning tasks in cognitive
              science often have a lower complexity9,10 and impose a ceiling
              for the depth to which any player can plan. Here we investigate
              expertise in a complex board game that offers ample opportunity
              for skilled players to plan deeply. We use model fitting methods
              to show that human behaviour can be captured using a
              computational cognitive model based on heuristic search. To
              validate this model, we predict human choices, response times and
              eye movements. We also perform a Turing test and a reconstruction
              experiment. Using the model, we find robust evidence for
              increased planning depth with expertise in both laboratory and
              large-scale mobile data. Experts memorize and reconstruct board

               propose a new testbed that requires an agent to reason about
               physical scenarios and take an action appropriately. Inspired by
               the physical knowledge acquired in infancy and the capabilities
               required for robots to operate in real-world environments, we
               identify 15 essential physical scenarios. We create a wide
               variety of distinct task templates, and we ensure that all the
               task templates within the same scenario can be solved by using
               one specific strategic physical rule. By having such a design,
               we evaluate two distinct levels of generalization, namely local
               generalization and broad generalization. We conduct an extensive
               evaluation with human players, learning agents with various
               input types and architectures, and heuristic agents with
               different strategies. Inspired by how the human intelligence
               quotient is calculated, we define the physical reasoning
               quotient (Phy-Q score) that reflects the physical reasoning
               intelligence of an agent using the physical scenarios we
               considered. Our evaluation shows that (1) all the agents are far

              hypothesis ran into difficulties, which led to an alternative

              a unique nesting behavior assay, we confirmed a ``critical
              period'' for developing music preference in C57BL/6 mice. Early
              music exposure between postnatal days 15 and 24 reversed their
              innate bias for silent shelter, which typically could not be
              altered in adulthood. Instead, exposing adult mice treated
              acutely with valproic acid or carrying a targeted deletion of the
              Nogo receptor (NgR(-/-)) unmasked a strong plasticity of
              preference consistent with a reopening of the critical period as
              seen in other systems. Imaging of cFos expression revealed a
              prominent neuronal activation in response to the exposed music in
              the prelimbic and infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex only under
              conditions of open plasticity. Neither behavioral changes nor

              possibility that such systems represent the world like we do.
              However, even seemingly intelligent machines fail in strange and
              ``unhumanlike'' ways, threatening their status as models of our
              minds. How can we know when human-machine behavioral differences

              such failures are only superficial or peripheral? This article
              draws on a foundational insight from cognitive science-the
              distinction between performance and competence-to encourage
              ``species-fair'' comparisons between humans and machines. The
              performance/competence distinction urges us to consider whether
              the failure of a system to behave as ideally hypothesized, or the
              failure of one creature to behave like another, arises not
              because the system lacks the relevant knowledge or internal
              capacities (``competence''), but instead because of superficial
              constraints on demonstrating that knowledge (``performance''). I
              argue that this distinction has been neglected by research
              comparing human and machine behavior, and that it should be
              essential to any such comparison. Focusing on the domain of image

              species-fairness of human-machine comparisons, extracted from
              recent work that equates such constraints. Species-fair
              comparisons level the playing field between natural and

              structure dependence and so will not move the auxiliary from the
              relative clause. However, simple recurrent networks are also able
              to avoid such errors, on the basis of surface distributional
              properties of the input (Lewis \& Elman, 2001; Reali \&

               that ``Aha!'' moment, when sudden clarity emerges from a tangled
               web of thoughts and ideas? This research integrates
               psychological work on insight with graph theoretic work on

               how insight occurs, how it is similar to and different from more
               typical learning processes, and why it yields an affective
               response in the individual. I propose that cognitive insight
               occurs when an atypical association, forged through random
               recombination or directed search, results in a ``shortcut'' in
               an individual's network of representations. This causes a rapid

               understanding of the relationships within and among the affected
               representations, and can prompt a cascade of other connections.

              detrimental to function. But despite the large trial-to-trial
              variability of neural activity and behavior, humans and other
              animals show a remarkable adaptability to unexpected adverse
              events occurring during task execution. This cognitive ability,
              described as constitutive of general intelligence, is missing
              from current artificial intelligence (AI) systems which feature
              exact (noise-free) computations. Here we show that implementing
              computation noise in recurrent neural networks boosts their
              cognitive resilience to a variety of adverse conditions entirely
              unseen during training, in a way that resembles human and animal
              cognition. In contrast to artificial agents with exact
              computations, noisy agents exhibit hallmarks of Bayesian
              inference acquired in a `zero-shot' fashion -- without prior
              experience with conditions that require these computations for
              maximizing rewards. We further demonstrate that these cognitive
              benefits result from free-standing regularization of activity
              patterns in noisy neural networks. Together, these findings
              suggest that intelligence may ride on computation noise to
              promote near-optimal decision-making in adverse conditions

  abstract = "Quantitative models of behavior are a fundamental tool in
              cognitive science. Typically, models are hand-crafted to
              implement specific cognitive mechanisms. Such ``classic'' models
              are interpretable by design, but may provide poor fit to
              experimental data. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), on the
              contrary, can fit arbitrary datasets at the cost of opaque
              mechanisms. Here, we adopt a hybrid approach, combining the
              predictive power of ANNs with the interpretability of classic
              models. We apply this approach to Reinforcement Learning (RL),
              beginning with classic RL models and replacing their components
              one-by-one with ANNs. We find that hybrid models can provide
              similar fit to fully-general ANNs, while retaining the
              interpretability of classic cognitive models: They reveal
              reward-based learning mechanisms in humans that are strikingly
              similar to classic RL. They also reveal mechanisms not contained
              in classic models, including separate rewardblind mechanisms, and
              the specific memory contents relevant to reward-based and

              discoveries, yet their computational underpinnings are not well

              probabilistic inference about the right structural form---where
              form could be a tree, ring, chain, grid, etc. (Kemp \& Tenenbaum,
              2008). Although this approach can learn intuitive organizations,
              including a tree for animals and a ring for the color circle, it
              assumes a strong inductive bias that considers only these
              particular forms, and each form is explicitly provided as initial

              organizing structure can be discovered, utilizing a broad

              learn complex structures for domains that lack intuitive
              description, as well as predict human property induction

  abstract = "The disambiguation of a syntactically ambiguous sentence in favor
              of a less preferred parse can lead to slower reading at the
              disambiguation point. This phenomenon, referred to as a
              garden-path effect, has motivated models in which readers
              initially maintain only a subset of the possible parses of the
              sentence, and subsequently require time-consuming reanalysis to
              reconstruct a discarded parse. A more recent proposal argues that
              the garden-path effect can be reduced to surprisal arising in a
              fully parallel parser: words consistent with the initially
              dispreferred but ultimately correct parse are simply less
              predictable than those consistent with the incorrect parse. Since
              predictability has pervasive effects in reading far beyond
              garden-path sentences, this account, which dispenses with
              reanalysis mechanisms, is more parsimonious. Crucially, it
              predicts a linear effect of surprisal: the garden-path effect is
              expected to be proportional to the difference in word surprisal
              between the ultimately correct and ultimately incorrect
              interpretations. To test this prediction, we used recurrent
              neural network language models to estimate word-by-word surprisal
              for three temporarily ambiguous constructions. We then estimated
              the slowdown attributed to each bit of surprisal from human
              self-paced reading times, and used that quantity to predict
              syntactic disambiguation difficulty. Surprisal successfully
              predicted the existence of garden-path effects, but drastically
              underpredicted their magnitude, and failed to predict their
              relative severity across constructions. We conclude that a full
              explanation of syntactic disambiguation difficulty may require
              recovery mechanisms beyond predictability.",

              furnished surprisingly few mechanistic insights. We attribute
              this slow mechanistic progress to the fact that cognitive
              scientists insist on performing underdetermined exercises,
              deriving overparametrized mechanistic theories of complex
              behaviors and seeking validation of these theories to the elusive
              notions of optimality and biological plausibility. We propose
              that mechanistic progress in Cognitive Science will accelerate
              once cognitive scientists start focusing on simpler explananda
              that will enable them to chart an atlas of elementary cognitive
              operations. Looking forward, the next challenge for Cognitive
              Science will be to understand how these elementary cognitive
              processes are pieced together to explain complex behavior.",

              children transition to school. Theoretical models and
              cross-sectional studies suggest that a speed-accuracy tradeoff
              may be operating across this transition, but the lack of
              longitudinal studies makes this transition difficult to
              understand. The current study explored the longitudinal and
              bidirectional associations between accuracy and RT on the DCCS
              (mixed block) at 5, 6, and 7 years of age using cross-lagged
              panel analyses. The study also examined the roles of working
              memory and language, as potential longitudinal mediators between
              RT at Time X and accuracy at Time X + 1, and explored the role of
              inhibitory control. The sample consisted of 425 children from the
              Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. Results show
              lagged associations from slower RT to greater improvements in
              accuracy between 5 and 6 years and between 6 and 7 years.
              Further, higher accuracy at 6 years predicted faster RT at 7

              at 5 years and accuracy at 6 years. These results provide needed
              longitudinal evidence to support theoretical claims that slower
              RT precedes improved accuracy in the development of cognitive
              flexibility, that working memory may be involved in the early

               system of communication---has been hailed as one of the major
               transitions in evolution. By enabling symbolic culture, language
               allows humans to draw on and expand on the knowledge of their
               ancestors and peers. A common assumption among linguists and
               psychologists is that although language is critical to our
               ability to share our thoughts, it plays a minor, if any, role in
               generating, controlling, and structuring them. I examine some

               language-augmented cognition. I focus on one of the fundamental

  abstract = "An important part of children's social and cognitive development
              is their understanding that people are psychological beings with
              internal, mental states including desire, intention, perception,
              and belief. A full understanding of people as psychological
              beings requires a representational theory of mind (ToM), which is
              an understanding that mental states can faithfully represent
              reality, or misrepresent reality. For the last 35 years,
              researchers have relied on false-belief tasks as the gold
              standard to test children's understanding that beliefs can
              misrepresent reality. In false-belief tasks, children are asked
              to reason about the behavior of agents who have false beliefs
              about situations. Although a large body of evidence indicates
              that most children pass false-belief tasks by the end of the
              preschool years, the evidence we present in this monograph
              suggests that most children do not understand false beliefs or,
              surprisingly, even true beliefs until middle childhood. We argue
              that young children pass false-belief tasks without understanding
              false beliefs by using perceptual access reasoning (PAR). With
              PAR, children understand that seeing leads to knowing in the
              moment, but not that knowing also arises from thinking or
              persists as memory and belief after the situation changes. By the
              same token, PAR leads children to fail true-belief tasks. PAR
              theory can account for performance on other traditional tests of
              representational ToM and related tasks, and can account for the
              factors that have been found to correlate with or affect both
              true- and false-belief performance. The theory provides a new
              laboratory measure which we label the belief understanding scale
              (BUS). This scale can distinguish between a child who is
              operating with PAR versus a child who is understanding beliefs.
              This scale provides a method needed to allow the study of the
              development of representational ToM. In this monograph, we report
              the outcome of the tests that we have conducted of predictions
              generated by PAR theory. The findings demonstrated signature PAR
              limitations in reasoning about the mind during the ages when
              children are hypothesized to be using PAR. In Chapter II,
              secondary analyses of the published true-belief literature
              revealed that children failed several types of true-belief tasks.
              Chapters III through IX describe new empirical data collected
              across multiple studies between 2003 and 2014 from 580 children
              aged 4-7 years, as well as from a small sample of 14 adults.
              Participants were recruited from the Phoenix, Arizona
              metropolitan area. All participants were native English-speakers.
              Children were recruited from university-sponsored and community
              preschools and daycare centers, and from hospital maternity
              wards. Adults were university students who participated to
              partially fulfill course requirements for research participation.
              Sociometric data were collected only in Chapter IX, and are fully
              reported there. In Chapter III, minor alterations in task
              procedures produced wide variations in children's performance in
              3-option false-belief tasks. In Chapter IV, we report findings
              which show that the developmental lag between children's
              understanding ignorance and understanding false belief is longer
              than the lag reported in previous studies. In Chapter V, children
              did not distinguish between agents who have false beliefs versus
              agents who have no beliefs. In Chapter VI, findings showed that
              children found it no easier to reason about true beliefs than to
              reason about false beliefs. In Chapter VII, when children were
              asked to justify their correct answers in false-belief tasks,
              they did not reference agents' false beliefs. Similarly, in
              Chapter VIII, when children were asked to explain agents' actions
              in false-belief tasks, they did not reference agents' false
              beliefs. In Chapter IX, children who were identified as using PAR
              differed from children who understood beliefs along three
              dimensions-in levels of social development, inhibitory control,
              and kindergarten adjustment. Although the findings need
              replication and additional studies of alternative
              interpretations, the collection of results reported in this
              monograph challenges the prevailing view that representational
              ToM is in place by the end of the preschool years. Furthermore,
              the pattern of findings is consistent with the proposal that PAR
              is the developmental precursor of representational ToM. The
              current findings also raise questions about claims that infants
              and toddlers demonstrate ToM-related abilities, and that
              representational ToM is innate.",

  author   = "Hubel, D H and Wiesel, T N",
  abstract = "1. Kittens were visually deprived by suturing the lids of the
              right eye for various periods of time at different ages.
              Recordings were subsequently made from the striate cortex, and
              responses from the two eyes compared. As previously reported,
              monocular eye closure during the first few months of life causes
              a sharp decline in the number of cells that can be influenced by
              the previously closed eye.2. Susceptibility to the effects of eye
              closure begins suddenly near the start of the fourth week,
              remains high until some time between the sixth and eighth weeks,
              and then declines, disappearing finally around the end of the
              third month. Monocular closure for over a year in an adult cat
              produces no detectable effects.3. During the period of high
              susceptibility in the fourth and fifth weeks eye closure for as
              little as 3-4 days leads to a sharp decline in the number of
              cells that can be driven from both eyes, as well as an over-all
              decline in the relative influence of the previously closed eye. A
              6-day closure is enough to give a reduction in the number of
              cells that can be driven by the closed eye to a fraction of the
              normal. The physiological picture is similar to that following a
              3-month monocular deprivation from birth, in which the proportion
              of cells the eye can influence drops from 85 to about 7\%.4.
              Cells of the lateral geniculate receiving input from a deprived
              eye are noticeably smaller and paler to Nissl stain following 3
              or 6 days' deprivation during the fourth week.5. Following 3
              months of monocular deprivation, opening the eye for up to 5 yr
              produces only a very limited recovery in the cortical physiology,
              and no obvious recovery of the geniculate atrophy, even though
              behaviourally there is some return of vision in the deprived eye.

              brain is particularly strong during a limited period in
              development, this period is referred to as a sensitive period.
              Such periods allow experience to instruct neural circuits to
              process or represent information in a way that is adaptive for
              the individual. When experience provides information that is
              essential for normal development and alters performance
              permanently, such sensitive periods are referred to as critical
              periods. Although sensitive periods are reflected in behavior,
              they are actually a property of neural circuits. Mechanisms of
              plasticity at the circuit level are discussed that have been
              shown to operate during sensitive periods. A hypothesis is
              proposed that experience during a sensitive period modifies the
              architecture of a circuit in fundamental ways, causing certain
              patterns of connectivity to become highly stable and, therefore,
              energetically preferred. Plasticity that occurs beyond the end of
              a sensitive period, which is substantial in many circuits, alters
              connectivity patterns within the architectural constraints
              established during the sensitive period. Preferences in a circuit
              that result from experience during sensitive periods are
              illustrated graphically as changes in a ''stability landscape,''
              a metaphor that represents the relative contributions of genetic
              and experiential influences in shaping the information processing

              interpret the object as intentional and assign to it the unique

              showed infants (average age 52 weeks) computer-generated
              animations of spontaneously moving ``balls,'' using looking time

               unresolved issue from the point of ecological validity is the
               training data, typically consisting of images or videos paired
               with spoken descriptions of what is depicted. Such a setup
               guarantees an unrealistically strong correlation between speech

              narrowly to similar items. We adopted this framework to human
              fear conditioning and found that fear conditioned to typical
              exemplars generalized more readily to atypical members than vice

              adults and infants to extract patterns of stimulation embedded in

              learning operates implicitly, without instruction, through mere

  abstract  = "Retrieval is the key process for understanding learning and for
               promoting learning, yet retrieval is not often granted the
               central role it deserves. Learning is typically identified with
               the encoding or construction of knowledge, and retrieval is
               considered merely the assessment of learning that occurred in a
               prior experience. The retrieval-based learning perspective
               outlined here is grounded in the fact that all expressions of
               knowledge involve retrieval and depend on the retrieval cues
               available in a given context. Further, every time a person
               retrieves knowledge, that knowledge is changed, because
               retrieving knowledge improves one?s ability to retrieve it again
               in the future. Practicing retrieval does not merely produce
               rote, transient learning; it produces meaningful, long-term
               learning. Yet retrieval practice is a tool many students lack
               metacognitive awareness of and do not use as often as they
               should. Active retrieval is an effective but undervalued

              Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology",

              Nathan, Mitchell J and Willingham, Daniel T",
  abstract = "Many students are being left behind by an educational system that
              some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes
              will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of
              this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping
              students to better regulate their learning through the use of
              effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and
              educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating
              easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve
              their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning
              techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their
              relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be
              relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many
              students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and
              rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily
              on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well
              they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation,
              self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining),
              the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading,
              practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice.
              To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these
              techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across
              four categories of variables: learning conditions, student
              characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning
              conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which
              the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies
              alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables
              such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials
              vary from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated
              science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures
              that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping
              memory, problem solving, and comprehension. We attempted to
              provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is
              rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular
              fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is
              divided into the following sections: General description of the
              technique and why it should work How general are the effects of
              this technique? 2a. Learning conditions 2b. Student
              characteristics 2c. Materials 2d. Criterion tasks Effects in
              representative educational contexts Issues for implementation
              Overall assessment The review for each technique can be read
              independently of the others, and particular variables of interest
              can be easily compared across techniques. To foreshadow our final
              recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their
              generalizability and promise for improving student learning.
              Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility
              assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and
              abilities and have been shown to boost students' performance
              across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts.
              Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved
              practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of
              these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite
              their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment
              because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance,
              elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been
              adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of
              interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so
              the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently
              unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques that received
              moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend
              their use in appropriate situations, which we describe in detail
              within the review of each technique. Five techniques received a
              low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword
              mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These
              techniques were rated as low utility for numerous reasons.
              Summarization and imagery use for text learning have been shown
              to help some students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions
              under which these techniques produce benefits are limited, and
              much research is still needed to fully explore their overall
              effectiveness. The keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in
              some contexts, and it appears to benefit students for a limited
              number of materials and for short retention intervals. Most
              students report rereading and highlighting, yet these techniques
              do not consistently boost students' performance, so other
              techniques should be used in their place (e.g., practice testing
              instead of rereading). Our hope is that this monograph will
              foster improvements in student learning, not only by showcasing
              which learning techniques are likely to have the most
              generalizable effects but also by encouraging researchers to
              continue investigating the most promising techniques.
              Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some issues for
              how these techniques could be implemented by teachers and
              students, and we highlight directions for future research.",

              individuals to focus effort on useful information they do not yet
              possess, can expose information that is inaccessible via passive
              observation, and may enhance the encoding and retention of
              materials. On the computational side, the development of

              own training data is an emerging research topic in machine
              learning. This review argues that recent advances in these

  abstract  = "Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the
               question of how to represent time in connectionist models is
               very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by
               its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a
               spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal
               along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which
               involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks
               with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns
               are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which
               develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior
               internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range
               from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to
               discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks
               are able to learn interesting internal representations which
               incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this
               approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task
               processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which
               allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing
               generalizations across classes of items. These representations

               four different problem types formed by combining insight versus
               non-insight and verbal versus spatial factors. The groups were
               given different verbalization instructions viz., Silent (N=40)
               or Direct Concurrent (N=40). There were significant differences
               between insight and non-insight tasks and between spatial and
               verbal tasks in terms of solution rates and latencies.
               Significant interactions between the verbal versus spatial
               factor and verbalization condition on solution rates and
               latencies reflected a greater (negative) effect of verbalizing
               on spatial as against verbal problems. However, no significant
               interactions of the insight versus non-insight factor with
               verbalization condition on solution rates or latencies were
               found. These results favoured the 'business as usual' view of
               insight problem solving as against the 'special process' view
               which predicted larger effects of verbalization for insight

  abstract = "There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily
              data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex
              datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis
              algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain
              processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if
              they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the
              algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even
              correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor
              as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary
              experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from
              neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information.
              Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing
              systems that are both complex and that we understand at all
              levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the
              dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal
              interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully
              describe the hierarchy of information processing in the
              microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in
              neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding
              of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data.
              Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear
              dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the

  abstract = "Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
              trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict
              cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the
              internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and
              the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we
              develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into
              the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We
              focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a
              scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a
              previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the
              OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of
              scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move
              within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this
              affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely
              feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep
              CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously
              trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the
              CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in
              the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA
              variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The
              CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of
              affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of
              in silico experiments on this model to gain insights into its
              internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation
              of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual
              information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal
              orientations, both of which have previously been identified as
              lowlevel stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex.
              These computations also exhibited a strong preference for
              information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with
              known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature
              selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based
              responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial
              environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large
              extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory
              functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that
              provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly,
              they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual
              cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification
              of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying
              algorithms.",

               were not pre-trained on natural language data before being

               the syntactic capabilities of seq2seq models may have been

              the environment and common to all species members, such as the
              basic elements of pattern perception. Experience-expectant
              processes appear to have evolved as a neural preparation for
              incorporating specific information: in many sensory systems,
              synaptic connections between nerve cells are overproduced, and a
              subsequent selection process occurs in which aspects of sensory
              experience determine the pattern of connections that remains.
              Experience-dependent information storage refers to incorporation

              single child's experience? We examine this question using a
              recent longitudinal dataset collected from a single child,
              consisting of egocentric visual data paired with text
              transcripts. We train both language-only and vision-and-language
              neural networks and analyze the linguistic knowledge they
              acquire. In parallel with findings from Elman's (1990) seminal
              work, the neural networks form emergent clusters of words
              corresponding to syntactic (nouns, transitive and intransitive
              verbs) and semantic categories (e.g., animals and clothing),
              based solely on one child's linguistic input. The networks also
              acquire sensitivity to acceptability contrasts from linguistic
              phenomena such as determiner-noun agreement and argument
              structure. We find that incorporating visual information produces
              an incremental gain in predicting words in context, especially
              for syntactic categories that are comparatively more easily
              grounded such as nouns and verbs, but the underlying linguistic
              representations are not fundamentally altered. Our findings
              demonstrate which kinds of linguistic knowledge are learnable
              from a snapshot of a single child's real developmental
              experience, and which kinds may benefit from stronger inductive
              biases or richer sources of data.",

              work, we present a theoretical framework that explains why we
              experience Aha! moments. Our theory posits that during
              problem-solving, in addition to solving the problem, people also
              maintain a metacognitive model of their ability to solve the
              problem as well as a prediction about the time it would take them
              to solve that problem. Aha! moments arise when we experience a
              positive error in this metacognitive prediction, i.e. when we
              solve a problem much faster than we expected to solve it. We
              posit that this metacognitive error is analogous to a positive
              reward prediction error thereby explaining why we feel so good

              We believe that studying cognition using games can generate

              paper is the first, to our knowledge, to examine this
              systematically and empirically. We find that people do not commit
              to basic properties of specified mental scenes (Studies 1 and 2),
              and that people report non-commitment rather than uncertainty or
              forgetfulness (Study 3). Such non-commitment is present even for
              people with generally vivid imaginations, and those who report
              imagining the specified scene very vividly (Studies 4a, 4b).
              People readily confabulate properties of their mental images when
              non-commitment is not offered as an explicit option (Study 5).

              problems are approached by repeatedly simulating relevant aspects

               Accelerometry data suggest that a majority of U.S. adults fail
               to perform substantial levels of physical activity needed to
               improve health. Thus, understanding the molecular factors that
               stimulate physical activity, and physical inactivity, is
               imperative for the development of strategies to reduce sedentary
               behavior and in turn prevent chronic disease. Despite many of
               the well-known health benefits of physical activity being
               described, little is known about genetic and biological factors
               that may influence this complex behavior. The mesolimbic
               dopamine system regulates motivating and rewarding behavior as
               well as motor movement. Here, we present data supporting the
               hypothesis that obesity may mechanistically lower voluntary
               physical activity levels via dopamine dysregulation. In doing
               so, we review data that suggests mesolimbic dopamine activity is
               a strong contributor to voluntary physical activity behavior. We
               also summarize findings suggesting that obesity leads to central
               dopaminergic dysfunction, which in turn contributes to
               reductions in physical activity that often accompany obesity.
               Additionally, we highlight examples in which central leptin
               activity influences physical activity levels in a
               dopamine-dependent manner. Future elucidation of these

  author   = "Wilson, Andrew D and Golonka, Sabrina",
  abstract = "The most exciting hypothesis in cognitive science right now is
              the theory that cognition is embodied. Like all good ideas in
              cognitive science, however, embodiment immediately came to mean
              six different things. The most common definitions involve the
              straight-forward claim that ``states of the body modify states of
              the mind.'' However, the implications of embodiment are actually
              much more radical than this. If cognition can span the brain,
              body, and the environment, then the ``states of mind'' of
              disembodied cognitive science won't exist to be modified.
              Cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a
              broad array of resources. Taking embodiment seriously therefore
              requires both new methods and theory. Here we outline four key
              steps that research programs should follow in order to fully
              engage with the implications of embodiment. The first step is to
              conduct a task analysis, which characterizes from a first person
              perspective the specific task that a perceiving-acting cognitive
              agent is faced with. The second step is to identify the
              task-relevant resources the agent has access to in order to solve
              the task. These resources can span brain, body, and environment.
              The third step is to identify how the agent can assemble these
              resources into a system capable of solving the problem at hand.
              The last step is to test the agent's performance to confirm that
              agent is actually using the solution identified in step 3. We
              explore these steps in more detail with reference to two useful
              examples (the outfielder problem and the A-not-B error), and
              introduce how to apply this analysis to the thorny question of
              language use. Embodied cognition is more than we think it is, and

              the unconscious mechanism of problem solving during insight tasks
              is a Darwinian process. It is based on the evolution of patterns
              that represent candidate solutions to a problem, and are stored
              and reproduced by a population of attractor networks. In our
              first experiment, we used human data as a benchmark and showed
              that the model behaves comparably to humans: it shows an
              improvement in performance if it is pretrained and primed
              appropriately, just like human participants in Kershaw et al.
              (2013)'s experiment. In the second experiment, we further
              investigated the effects of pretraining and priming in a
              two-by-two design and found a beginner's luck type of effect:
              solution rate was highest in the condition that was primed, but
              not pretrained with patterns relevant for the task. In the third

               sessions in a counterbalanced order on separate days. The
               exercise sessions consisted of 5 min of warm up exercises
               followed by 30 min of running or badminton. The exercise
               intensity was set at 60\% ($\pm$5\%) of the heart rate reserve

               levels (a proxy for levels of BDNF in the brain) and near

              placed within, and introduces, a more elaborate theory that is
              being developed to predict the phenomena of explicit and
              implicit, and episodic and generic, memory. The recognition model
              is applied to basic findings, including phenomena that pose
              problems for extant models: the list-strength effect (e.g.,
              Ratcliff, Clark, \& Shiffrin, 1990), the mirror effect (e.g.,
              Glanzer \& Adams, 1990), and the normal-ROC slope effect (e.g.,
              Ratcliff, McKoon, \& Tindall, 1994). The model assumes storage of
              separate episodic images for different words, each image
              consisting of a vector of feature values. Each image is an
              incomplete and error prone copy of the studied vector. For the
              simplest case, it is possible to calculate the probability that a
              test item is ``old,'' and it is assumed that a default ``old''
              response is given if this probability is greater than .5. It is
              demonstrated that this model and its more complete and realistic
              versions produce excellent qualitative predictions.",

  author   = "Ash, Ivan K and Wiley, Jennifer",
  abstract = "The insightful problem-solving process has been proposed to
              involve three main phases: an initial representation phase, in
              which the solver inappropriately represents the problem; an
              initial search through the faulty problem space that may lead to
              impasse; and a postimpasse restructuring phase. Some theories
              propose that the restructuring phase involves controlled search
              processes, whereas other theories propose that restructuring is
              achieved through the automatic redistribution of activation in
              long-term memory. In this study, we used correlations between
              working memory (WM) span measures and problem-solving success to
              test the predictions of these different theories. One group of
              participants received a set of insight problems that allowed for
              a large initial faulty search space, whereas another group
              received a matched set that constrained the initial faulty search
              space in order to isolate the restructuring phase of the
              insightful process. The results suggest that increased ability to
              control attention (as measured by WM span tasks) predicts an
              individual's ability to successfully solve problems that involve
              both the initial search phase and the restructuring phase.
              However, individual differences in ability to control attention
              do not predict success on problems that isolate the restructuring
              phase. These results are interpreted as supporting an
              automatic-redistribution-of-activation account of restructuring.",

                 Intelligence (AI), after a half-century of AI repeatedly
                 failing to meet expectations. What explains the dramatic
                 change from 20th-century to 21st-century AI, and how can
                 remaining limitations of current AI be overcome? Until now,
                 the widely accepted narrative has attributed the recent
                 progress in AI to technical engineering advances that have
                 yielded massive increases in the quantity of computational
                 resources and training data available to support statistical
                 learning in deep artificial neural networks. Although these
                 quantitative engineering innovations are important, here we
                 show that the latest advances in AI are not solely due to
                 quantitative increases in computing power but also qualitative
                 changes in how that computing power is deployed. These
                 qualitative changes have brought about a new type of computing
                 that we call neurocompositional computing. In
                 neurocompositional computing, neural networks exploit two
                 scientific principles that contemporary theory in cognitive
                 science maintains are simultaneously necessary to enable
                 human-level cognition. The Compositionality Principle asserts
                 that encodings of complex information are structures that are
                 systematically composed from simpler structured encodings. The
                 Continuity Principle states that the encoding and processing
                 of information is formalized with real numbers that vary
                 continuously. These principles have seemed irreconcilable
                 until the recent mathematical discovery that compositionality
                 can be realized not only through the traditional discrete
                 methods of symbolic computing, well developed in 20th-century
                 AI, but also through novel forms of continuous neural
                 computing---neurocompositional computing. The unprecedented
                 progress of 21st-century AI has resulted from the use of
                 limited---first-generation---forms of neurocompositional
                 computing. We show that the new techniques now being deployed
                 in second-generation neurocompositional computing create AI
                 systems that are not only more robust and accurate than
                 current systems, but also more comprehensible---making it
                 possible to diagnose errors in, and exert human control over,
                 artificial neural networks through interpretation of their
                 internal states and direct intervention upon those states.

  title    = "Mapping Language Models to Grounded Conceptual Spaces",
  author   = "Patel, Roma and Pavlick, Ellie",
  abstract = "A fundamental criticism of text-only language models (LMs) is
              their lack of grounding---that is, the ability to tie a word for
              which they have learned a representation, to its actual use in
              the world. However, despite this limitation, large pre-trained
              LMs have been shown to have a remarkable grasp of the conceptual
              structure of language, as demonstrated by their ability to answer
              questions, generate fluent text, or make inferences about
              entities, objects, and properties that they have never physically
              observed. In this work we investigate the extent to which the
              rich conceptual structure that LMs learn indeed reflects the
              conceptual structure of the non-linguistic world---which is
              something that LMs have never observed. We do this by testing
              whether the LMs can learn to map an entire conceptual domain
              (e.g., direction or colour) onto a grounded world representation
              given only a small number of examples. For example, we show a
              model what the word ``left`` means using a textual depiction of a
              grid world, and assess how well it can generalise to related
              concepts, for example, the word ``right'', in a similar grid
              world. We investigate a range of generative language models of
              varying sizes (including GPT-2 and GPT-3), and see that although
              the smaller models struggle to perform this mapping, the largest
              model can not only learn to ground the concepts that it is
              explicitly taught, but appears to generalise to several instances
              of unseen concepts as well. Our results suggest an alternative
              means of building grounded language models: rather than learning
              grounded representations ``from scratch'', it is possible that
              large text-only models learn a sufficiently rich conceptual
              structure that could allow them to be grounded in a
              data-efficient way.",

  abstract = "Human concept learning is particularly impressive in two
              respects: the internal structure of concepts can be
              representationally rich, and yet the very same concepts can also
              be learned from just a few examples. Several decades of research
              have dramatically advanced our understanding of these two aspects
              of concepts. While the richness and speed of concept learning are
              most often studied in isolation, the power of human concepts may
              be best explained through their synthesis. This paper presents a
              large-scale empirical study of one-shot concept learning,
              suggesting that rich generative knowledge in the form of a motor
              program can be induced from just a single example of a novel
              concept. Participants were asked to draw novel handwritten
              characters given a reference form, and we recorded the motor data
              used for production. Multiple drawers of the same character not
              only produced visually similar drawings, but they also showed a
              striking correspondence in their strokes, as measured by their
              number, shape, order, and direction. This suggests that
              participants can infer a rich motorbased concept from a single
              example. We also show that the motor programs induced by
              individual subjects provide a powerful basis for one-shot
              classification, yielding far higher accuracy than

  abstract = "Some neurons in deep networks specialize in recognizing highly
              specific perceptual, structural, or semantic features of inputs.
              In computer vision, techniques exist for identifying neurons that
              respond to individual concept categories like colors, textures,
              and object classes. But these techniques are limited in scope,
              labeling only a small subset of neurons and behaviors in any
              network. Is a richer characterization of neuron-level computation
              possible? We introduce a procedure (called MILAN, for mutual
              information-guided linguistic annotation of neurons) that
              automatically labels neurons with open-ended, compositional,
              natural language descriptions. Given a neuron, MILAN generates a
              description by searching for a natural language string that
              maximizes pointwise mutual information with the image regions in
              which the neuron is active. MILAN produces fine-grained
              descriptions that capture categorical, relational, and logical
              structure in learned features. These descriptions obtain high
              agreement with human-generated feature descriptions across a
              diverse set of model architectures and tasks, and can aid in
              understanding and controlling learned models. We highlight three
              applications of natural language neuron descriptions. First, we
              use MILAN for analysis, characterizing the distribution and
              importance of neurons selective for attribute, category, and
              relational information in vision models. Second, we use MILAN for
              auditing, surfacing neurons sensitive to human faces in datasets
              designed to obscure them. Finally, we use MILAN for editing,
              improving robustness in an image classifier by deleting neurons
              sensitive to text features spuriously correlated with class

               reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a
               prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new

              of units of practice when unaccompanied by reward. The method
              devised was that of running two groups of rats through the maze:
              an experimental group which received no reward during the first
              part of learning, but which suddenly had reward introduced in the
              latter part of learning, and a control group which received
              reward throughout the whole of learning. The answer to the
              question as to the efficiency of non-reward units of practice was
              sought in a comparison of the learning curve of the experimental
              group (both before and after the introduction of reward) with
              that of the control group.'' Three mazes were used, two with
              ordinary blinds and one with blinds arranged so that the animal
              could go two ways as well as having as alternatives a long and a
              short path. ``They prevented retracings from one section of the
              maze to another, they were noiseless, and they caused no
              excitement in the animals.'' There were 36 rats in each group.
              The results show that: ``(1) Rats run under a non-reward
              condition learned much more slowly than rats run under a reward
              condition.'' ``(2) Rats previously run under a non-reward
              condition, when suddenly rewarded made a great improvement.''
              ``(3) During the non-reward period, the rats were developing a
              latent learning of the maze which they were able to utilize as
              soon as reward was introduced.'' ``(5) It was demonstrated by the
              use of the two-path maze that the latent learning which was
              developed under non-reward conditions and was made manifest as
              soon as reward was introduced was not the result of any very
              consistently greater frequency of the correct over the incorrect

                  encountered positive instances of a concept. Using a novel
                  rule induction task based on the children's game Zendo, we
                  compare these ``bottomup'' and ``top-down'' approaches to
                  inference. We find that the bottom-up IDG model accounts
                  better for human inferences and results in a computationally
                  more tractable inference mechanism for concept learning
                  models based on a probabilistic language of thought.",

  editor    = "Harnad, Stevan",
  abstract  = "``Categorical Perception'' brings together all the known
               examples of categorical perception, from research on humans and
               animals, infants and adults, in all the sense modalities so far
               investigated: hearing, seeing, and touch. The perceptual
               findings are interpreted in terms of the available cognitive and
               neuroscientific theories of how categorical perception is
               accomplished by the brain: Is it inborn? Is it learned? What is
               it that the mind does to the incoming continuous information to
               sort it into the discrete categories we can see, manipulate,
               name, and describe? Work on elementary perceptual and
               psychophysical categories (colors, sounds) is then compared with
               work on higher order categories: objects (tables, chairs),
               patterns, abstract concepts (goodness, truth). From a focus on
               the most thoroughly investigated case of categorical
               perception---speech perception---the book proceeds to an
               integrative view of categorization in general. (PsycINFO

  title    = "The Conceptual Mind : New Directions in the Study of Concepts",
  abstract = "``The study of concepts has advanced dramatically in recent
              years, with exciting new findings and theoretical developments.
              Core concepts have been investigated in greater depth and new
              lines of inquiry have blossomed, with researchers from an ever
              broader range of disciplines making important contributions. In
              this volume, leading philosophers and cognitive scientists offer
              original essays that present the state-of-the-art in the study of
              concepts. These essays, all commissioned for this book, do not
              merely present the usual surveys and overviews; rather, they
              offer the latest work on concepts by a diverse group of theorists
              as well as discussions of the ideas that should guide research
              over the next decade. The book is an essential companion volume
              to the earlier Concepts: Core Readings, the definitive source for
              classic texts on the nature of concepts. The essays cover
              concepts as they relate to animal cognition, the brain,
              evolution, perception, and language, concepts across cultures,
              concept acquisition and conceptual change, concepts and
