                   intelligence could be explained by a few principles (rather
                   than an encyclopedic list of heuristics). If that hypothesis
                   was correct, we could more easily both understand our own
                   intelligence and build intelligent machines. Just like in
                   physics, the principles themselves would not be sufficient
                   to predict the behavior of complex systems like brains, and
                   substantial computation might be needed to simulate
                   human-like intelligence. This hypothesis would suggest that
                   studying the kind of inductive biases that humans and
                   animals exploit could help both clarify these principles and
                   provide inspiration for AI research and neuroscience
                   theories. Deep learning already exploits several key
                   inductive biases, and this work considers a larger list,

              board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats

                 Intelligence (AI), after a half-century of AI repeatedly
                 failing to meet expectations. What explains the dramatic
                 change from 20th-century to 21st-century AI, and how can
                 remaining limitations of current AI be overcome? Until now,
                 the widely accepted narrative has attributed the recent
                 progress in AI to technical engineering advances that have
                 yielded massive increases in the quantity of computational
                 resources and training data available to support statistical
                 learning in deep artificial neural networks. Although these
                 quantitative engineering innovations are important, here we
                 show that the latest advances in AI are not solely due to
                 quantitative increases in computing power but also qualitative
                 changes in how that computing power is deployed. These
                 qualitative changes have brought about a new type of computing
                 that we call neurocompositional computing. In
                 neurocompositional computing, neural networks exploit two
                 scientific principles that contemporary theory in cognitive
                 science maintains are simultaneously necessary to enable
                 human-level cognition. The Compositionality Principle asserts
                 that encodings of complex information are structures that are
                 systematically composed from simpler structured encodings. The
                 Continuity Principle states that the encoding and processing
                 of information is formalized with real numbers that vary
                 continuously. These principles have seemed irreconcilable
                 until the recent mathematical discovery that compositionality
                 can be realized not only through the traditional discrete
                 methods of symbolic computing, well developed in 20th-century
                 AI, but also through novel forms of continuous neural
                 computing---neurocompositional computing. The unprecedented
                 progress of 21st-century AI has resulted from the use of
                 limited---first-generation---forms of neurocompositional
                 computing. We show that the new techniques now being deployed
                 in second-generation neurocompositional computing create AI
                 systems that are not only more robust and accurate than
                 current systems, but also more comprehensible---making it
                 possible to diagnose errors in, and exert human control over,
                 artificial neural networks through interpretation of their
                 internal states and direct intervention upon those states.

                 deep learning. Appendices provide more advanced material. Each
                 figure, and the associated box explaining it, provides an
                 exposition, illustration, or further details of a main point
                 of the paper; in order to make these figures relatively
                 self-contained, it has sometimes been necessary to repeat some
                 material from the text. For a brief introduction and
                 additional development of some of this material see

  abstract = "``The study of concepts has advanced dramatically in recent
              years, with exciting new findings and theoretical developments.
              Core concepts have been investigated in greater depth and new
              lines of inquiry have blossomed, with researchers from an ever
              broader range of disciplines making important contributions. In
              this volume, leading philosophers and cognitive scientists offer
              original essays that present the state-of-the-art in the study of
              concepts. These essays, all commissioned for this book, do not
              merely present the usual surveys and overviews; rather, they
              offer the latest work on concepts by a diverse group of theorists
              as well as discussions of the ideas that should guide research
              over the next decade. The book is an essential companion volume
              to the earlier Concepts: Core Readings, the definitive source for
              classic texts on the nature of concepts. The essays cover
              concepts as they relate to animal cognition, the brain,
              evolution, perception, and language, concepts across cultures,
              concept acquisition and conceptual change, concepts and

                   natural language provide a rich source of information about
                   the kinds of abstractions humans use to navigate the world.
                   Can this linguistic background knowledge improve the
                   generality and efficiency of learned classifiers and control
                   policies? This paper aims to show that using the space of
                   natural language strings as a parameter space is an
                   effective way to capture natural task structure. In a
                   pretraining phase, we learn a language interpretation model
                   that transforms inputs (e.g. images) into outputs (e.g.
                   labels) given natural language descriptions. To learn a new
                   concept (e.g. a classifier), we search directly in the space
                   of descriptions to minimize the interpreter's loss on
                   training examples. Crucially, our models do not require
                   language data to learn these concepts: language is used only
                   in pretraining to impose structure on subsequent learning.
                   Results on image classification, text editing, and
                   reinforcement learning show that, in all settings, models

  abstract = "Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
              trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict
              cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the
              internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and
              the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we
              develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into
              the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We
              focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a
              scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a
              previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the
              OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of
              scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move
              within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this
              affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely
              feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep
              CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously
              trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the
              CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in
              the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA
              variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The
              CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of
              affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of
              in silico experiments on this model to gain insights into its
              internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation
              of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual
              information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal
              orientations, both of which have previously been identified as
              lowlevel stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex.
              These computations also exhibited a strong preference for
              information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with
              known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature
              selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based
              responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial
              environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large
              extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory
              functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that
              provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly,
              they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual
              cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification

              machine learning and fMRI to test the hypothesis that object
              co-occurrence statistics are encoded in the human visual system
              and elicited by the perception of individual objects. We
              identified low-dimensional representations that capture the
              latent statistical structure of object co-occurrence in
              real-world scenes, and we mapped these statistical
              representations onto voxel-wise fMRI responses during object
              viewing. We found that cortical responses to single objects were
              predicted by the statistical ensembles in which they typically
              occur, and that this link between objects and their visual
              contexts was made most strongly in parahippocampal cortex,
              overlapping with the anterior portion of scene-selective

                   more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following
                   an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define
                   and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons
                   between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans.
                   Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of
                   attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the
                   fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically
                   assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while
                   making apparent the two historical conceptions of
                   intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that
                   in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates
                   towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill
                   exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks, such as board
                   games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill
                   at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence,
                   because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and
                   experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data
                   allow experimenters to ``buy'' arbitrary levels of skills
                   for a system, in a way that masks the system's own
                   generalization power. We then articulate a new formal
                   definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information
                   Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition
                   efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope,
                   generalization difficulty, priors, and experience, as
                   critical pieces to be accounted for in characterizing
                   intelligent systems. Using this definition, we propose a set
                   of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look
                   like. Finally, we present a new benchmark closely following
                   these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus
                   (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be
                   as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that
                   ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general
                   fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general

              subclass of such processes that producen-order statistical
              approximations to English do not come closer, with increasingn,
              to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the

               stream. This mapping was of high fidelity, with more than 60\%
               of the explainable variance in nine key regions being explained.

  abstract = "People can learn rich, general-purpose conceptual representations
              from only raw perceptual inputs. Current machine learning
              approaches fall well short of these human standards, although
              different modeling traditions often have complementary strengths.
              Symbolic models can capture the compositional and causal
              knowledge that enables flexible generalization, but they struggle
              to learn from raw inputs, relying on strong abstractions and
              simplifying assumptions. Neural network models can learn directly
              from raw data, but they struggle to capture compositional and
              causal structure and typically must retrain to tackle new tasks.
              We bring together these two traditions to learn generative models
              of concepts that capture rich compositional and causal structure,
              while learning from raw data. We develop a generative
              neuro-symbolic (GNS) model of handwritten character concepts that
              uses the control flow of a probabilistic program, coupled with
              symbolic stroke primitives and a symbolic image renderer, to
              represent the causal and compositional processes by which
              characters are formed. The distributions of parts (strokes), and
              correlations between parts, are modeled with neural network
              subroutines, allowing the model to learn directly from raw data
              and express nonparametric statistical relationships. We apply our
              model to the Omniglot challenge of human-level concept learning,
              using a background set of alphabets to learn an expressive prior
              distribution over character drawings. In a subsequent evaluation,
              our GNS model uses probabilistic inference to learn rich
              conceptual representations from a single training image that
              generalize to 4 unique tasks, succeeding where previous work has
              fallen short.",

  abstract = "This paper explores differences between Connectionist proposals
              for cognitive architecture and the sorts of models that have
              traditionally been assumed in cognitive science. We claim that
              the major distinction is that, while both Connectionist and
              Classical architectures postulate representational mental states,
              the latter but not the former are committed to a symbol-level of
              representation, or to a `language of thought': i.e., to
              representational states that have combinatorial syntactic and
              semantic structure. Several arguments for combinatorial structure
              in mental representations are then reviewed. These include
              arguments based on the `systematicity' of mental representation:
              i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit
              certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given
              thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with
              semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make
              a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist
              at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that
              Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or `abstract
              neurological') structures in which Classical cognitive
              architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard
              arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and
              conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation.

              localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data

  abstract = "Human concept learning is particularly impressive in two
              respects: the internal structure of concepts can be
              representationally rich, and yet the very same concepts can also
              be learned from just a few examples. Several decades of research
              have dramatically advanced our understanding of these two aspects
              of concepts. While the richness and speed of concept learning are
              most often studied in isolation, the power of human concepts may
              be best explained through their synthesis. This paper presents a
              large-scale empirical study of one-shot concept learning,
              suggesting that rich generative knowledge in the form of a motor
              program can be induced from just a single example of a novel
              concept. Participants were asked to draw novel handwritten
              characters given a reference form, and we recorded the motor data
              used for production. Multiple drawers of the same character not
              only produced visually similar drawings, but they also showed a
              striking correspondence in their strokes, as measured by their
              number, shape, order, and direction. This suggests that
              participants can infer a rich motorbased concept from a single
              example. We also show that the motor programs induced by
              individual subjects provide a powerful basis for one-shot
              classification, yielding far higher accuracy than

  abstract = "Both scientists and children make important structural

              probabilistic inference about the right structural form---where
              form could be a tree, ring, chain, grid, etc. (Kemp \& Tenenbaum,
              2008). Although this approach can learn intuitive organizations,
              including a tree for animals and a ring for the color circle, it
              assumes a strong inductive bias that considers only these
              particular forms, and each form is explicitly provided as initial
              knowledge. Here we introduce a new computational model of how
              organizing structure can be discovered, utilizing a broad
              hypothesis space with a preference for sparse connectivity. Given
              that the inductive bias is more general, the model's initial
              knowledge shows little qualitative resemblance to some of the
              discoveries it supports. As a consequence, the model can also
              learn complex structures for domains that lack intuitive
              description, as well as predict human property induction
              judgments without explicit structural forms. By allowing form to

              showed infants (average age 52 weeks) computer-generated
              animations of spontaneously moving ``balls,'' using looking time
              in a standard habituation/dishabituation paradigm. In two
              positive interactions, one ball either ``caressed'' another, or
              ``helped'' it achieve its goal; whereas in two negative
              interactions, one ball either ``hit`` another, or ``prevented''
              it from achieving its goal. In keeping with predictions of the
              model, when transferred to a negative condition, infants who had
              been habituated on a positive condition showed greater
              dishabituation than those habituated on a negative condition. The
              results could not be easily explained by the similarity relations
              among the animations depicting the interactions.The results
              suggest that well before the age when the child can ascribe
              mental states or has a ``theory of mind,'' it recognizes the
              goals of self-propelled objects and attributes value to the
              interactions between them.",

              been influenced by a range of direct and indirect selection
              pressures for both cognitive and non-cognitive functions and
              capabilities. It has been hypothesized that hominin brain
              expansion was, in part, a correlated response to selection acting
              on aerobic capacity (Raichlen \& Polk, 2013). According to this
              hypothesis, selection for aerobic capacity increased the activity
              of various signaling molecules, including those involved in brain
              growth. One key molecule is brain-derived neurotrophic factor
              (BDNF), a protein that regulates neuronal development, survival,
              and plasticity in mammals. This review updates, partially tests,
              and expands Raichlen and Polk's (2013) hypothesis by evaluating
              evidence for BDNF as a mediator of brain size. Discussion We
              contend that selection for endurance capabilities in a hot
              climate favored changes to muscle composition, mitochondrial
              dynamics and increased energy budget through pathways involving
              regulation of PGC-1$\alpha$ and MEF2 genes, both of which promote
              BDNF activity. In addition, the evolution of hairlessness and the
              skin's thermoregulatory response provide other molecular pathways
              that promote both BDNF activity and neurotransmitter synthesis.
              We discuss how these pathways contributed to the evolution of
              brain size and function in human evolution and propose avenues
              for future research. Our results support Raichlen and Polk's

               exercise sessions consisted of 5 min of warm up exercises
               followed by 30 min of running or badminton. The exercise

               improve health. Thus, understanding the molecular factors that

               imperative for the development of strategies to reduce sedentary
               behavior and in turn prevent chronic disease. Despite many of

               that may influence this complex behavior. The mesolimbic
               dopamine system regulates motivating and rewarding behavior as
               well as motor movement. Here, we present data supporting the

               dopaminergic dysfunction, which in turn contributes to
               reductions in physical activity that often accompany obesity.
               Additionally, we highlight examples in which central leptin

  author   = "Brooks, Rodney A",
  abstract = "Artificial intelligence research has foundered on the issue of
              representation. When intelligence is approached in an incremental
              manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world
              through perception and action, reliance on representation
              disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to
              incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The
              fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into
              independent information processing units which must interface
              with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent
              system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity
              producers which all interface directly to the world through
              perception and action, rather than interface to each other
              particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems
              evaporate---everything is both central and peripheral. Based on
              these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile
              robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard
              office environments.",

               the syntactic capabilities of seq2seq models may have been

  abstract      = "Natural language is perhaps the most flexible and intuitive
                   way for humans to communicate tasks to a robot. Prior work
                   in imitation learning typically requires each task be
                   specified with a task id or goal image -- something that is
                   often impractical in open-world environments. On the other
                   hand, previous approaches in instruction following allow
                   agent behavior to be guided by language, but typically
                   assume structure in the observations, actuators, or language
                   that limit their applicability to complex settings like
                   robotics. In this work, we present a method for
                   incorporating free-form natural language conditioning into
                   imitation learning. Our approach learns perception from
                   pixels, natural language understanding, and multitask
                   continuous control end-to-end as a single neural network.
                   Unlike prior work in imitation learning, our method is able
                   to incorporate unlabeled and unstructured demonstration data
                   (i.e. no task or language labels). We show this dramatically
                   improves language conditioned performance, while reducing
                   the cost of language annotation to less than 1\% of total
                   data. At test time, a single language conditioned visuomotor
                   policy trained with our method can perform a wide variety of
                   robotic manipulation skills in a 3D environment, specified
                   only with natural language descriptions of each task (e.g.
                   ``open the drawer...now pick up the block...now press the
                   green button...''). To scale up the number of instructions
                   an agent can follow, we propose combining text conditioned
                   policies with large pretrained neural language models. We
                   find this allows a policy to be robust to many
                   out-of-distribution synonym instructions, without requiring
                   new demonstrations. See videos of a human typing live text

  abstract = "A fundamental criticism of text-only language models (LMs) is
              their lack of grounding---that is, the ability to tie a word for
              which they have learned a representation, to its actual use in
              the world. However, despite this limitation, large pre-trained
              LMs have been shown to have a remarkable grasp of the conceptual
              structure of language, as demonstrated by their ability to answer
              questions, generate fluent text, or make inferences about
              entities, objects, and properties that they have never physically
              observed. In this work we investigate the extent to which the
              rich conceptual structure that LMs learn indeed reflects the
              conceptual structure of the non-linguistic world---which is
              something that LMs have never observed. We do this by testing
              whether the LMs can learn to map an entire conceptual domain
              (e.g., direction or colour) onto a grounded world representation
              given only a small number of examples. For example, we show a
              model what the word ``left`` means using a textual depiction of a
              grid world, and assess how well it can generalise to related
              concepts, for example, the word ``right'', in a similar grid
              world. We investigate a range of generative language models of
              varying sizes (including GPT-2 and GPT-3), and see that although
              the smaller models struggle to perform this mapping, the largest
              model can not only learn to ground the concepts that it is
              explicitly taught, but appears to generalise to several instances
              of unseen concepts as well. Our results suggest an alternative
              means of building grounded language models: rather than learning
              grounded representations ``from scratch'', it is possible that
              large text-only models learn a sufficiently rich conceptual
              structure that could allow them to be grounded in a
              data-efficient way.",

              > 1, 800), we find that most people are non-committal about basic
              aspects of their mental images, including features that would be
              readily apparent in real images. While previous work on the
              imagination has discussed the possibility of non-commitment, this
              paper is the first, to our knowledge, to examine this
              systematically and empirically. We find that people do not commit
              to basic properties of specified mental scenes (Studies 1 and 2),
              and that people report non-commitment rather than uncertainty or
              forgetfulness (Study 3). Such non-commitment is present even for
              people with generally vivid imaginations, and those who report
              imagining the specified scene very vividly (Studies 4a, 4b).
              People readily confabulate properties of their mental images when
              non-commitment is not offered as an explicit option (Study 5).
              Taken together, these results establish non-commitment as a
              pervasive component of mental imagery.",

                   models without requiring more labeled data. While effective,
                   feature extractors like BERT may be prohibitively large for
                   some deployment scenarios. We explore weight pruning for
                   BERT and ask: how does compression during pre-training
                   affect transfer learning? We find that pruning affects
                   transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of
                   pruning (30-40\%) do not affect pre-training loss or
                   transfer to downstream tasks at all. Medium levels of
                   pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful
                   pre-training information from being transferred to
                   downstream tasks. High levels of pruning additionally
                   prevent models from fitting downstream datasets, leading to
                   further degradation. Finally, we observe that fine-tuning
                   BERT on a specific task does not improve its prunability. We

                   instances, as a human would. In this paper, we argue that
                   understanding a concept requires the ability to use it in
                   varied contexts. Accordingly, we propose systematic
                   evaluations centered around concepts, by probing a system's
                   ability to use a given concept in many different
                   instantiations. We present case studies of such an
                   evaluations on two domains -- RAVEN (inspired by Raven's
                   Progressive Matrices) and the Abstraction and Reasoning
                   Corpus (ARC) -- that have been used to develop and assess
                   abstraction abilities in AI systems. Our concept-based
                   approach to evaluation reveals information about AI systems

  abstract      = "Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with
                   surging interest in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in
                   this domain heavily relies on faithful representation of the
                   sparsity of subnetworks, which has been traditionally
                   computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct
                   sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize
                   unpruned parameters that detached from input or output
                   layers of underlying subnetworks, potentially
                   underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of
                   inactivated connections. While this effect might be
                   negligible for moderately pruned networks (up to 10-100
                   compression rates), we find that it plays an increasing role
                   for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison
                   between different pruning algorithms. For example, we show
                   that effective compression of a randomly pruned
                   LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its
                   direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed
                   when using SynFlow for pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In
                   this work, we adopt the lens of effective sparsity to
                   reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common
                   benchmark architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19,
                   ResNet-18) and discover that their absolute and relative
                   performance changes dramatically in this new and more
                   appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than
                   direct, sparsity, we develop a low-cost extension to most
                   pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with effective
                   sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that
                   random pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across
                   layers performs as well or better than more sophisticated
                   algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et al., 2020].
                   In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of
                   pressure distribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we
                   design novel layerwise sparsity quotas that outperform all
                   existing baselines in the context of random pruning.",

                   tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of
                   text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While
                   typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still
                   requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or
                   tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can
                   generally perform a new language task from only a few
                   examples or from simple instructions - something which
                   current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we
                   show that scaling up language models greatly improves
                   task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching
                   competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
                   approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive
                   language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than
                   any previous non-sparse language model, and test its
                   performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
                   applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with
                   tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text
                   interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong
                   performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
                   question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several
                   tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain
                   adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word
                   in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same
                   time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot
                   learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where
                   GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on
                   large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate

                   difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

              shortcoming is their inability to dynamically and flexibly bind
              information that is distributed throughout the network. This
              binding problem affects their capacity to acquire a compositional
              understanding of the world in terms of symbol-like entities (like
              objects), which is crucial for generalizing in predictable and
              systematic ways. To address this issue, we propose a unifying
              framework that revolves around forming meaningful entities from
              unstructured sensory inputs (segregation), maintaining this
              separation of information at a representational level

              neuroscience and cognitive psychology, and surveys relevant
              mechanisms from the machine learning literature, to help identify
              a combination of inductive biases that allow symbolic information
              processing to emerge naturally in neural networks. We believe
              that a compositional approach to AI, in terms of grounded

              individuals to focus effort on useful information they do not yet
              possess, can expose information that is inaccessible via passive
              observation, and may enhance the encoding and retention of
              materials. On the computational side, the development of

  abstract = "Each of our theories of mental representation provides some
              insight into how the mind works. However, these insights often
              seem incompatible, as the debates between symbolic, dynamical,
              emergentist, sub-symbolic, and grounded approaches to cognition
              attest. Mental representations---whatever they are---must share
              many features with each of our theories of representation, and
              yet there are few hypotheses about how a synthesis could be
              possible. Here, I develop a theory of the underpinnings of
              symbolic cognition that shows how sub-symbolic dynamics may give
              rise to higher-level cognitive representations of structures,
              systems of knowledge, and algorithmic processes. This theory
              implements a version of conceptual role semantics by positing an
              internal universal representation language in which learners may
              create mental models to capture dynamics they observe in the
              world. The theory formalizes one account of how truly novel
              conceptual content may arise, allowing us to explain how even
              elementary logical and computational operations may be learned
              from a more primitive basis. I provide an implementation that
              learns to represent a variety of structures, including logic,
              number, kinship trees, regular languages, context-free languages,
              domains of theories like magnetism, dominance hierarchies, list
              structures, quantification, and computational primitives like
              repetition, reversal, and recursion. This account is based on
              simple discrete dynamical processes that could be implemented in
              a variety of different physical or biological systems. In
              particular, I describe how the required dynamics can be directly
              implemented in a connectionist framework. The resulting theory
              provides an ``assembly language'' for cognition, where high-level
              theories of symbolic computation can be implemented in simple
              dynamics that themselves could be encoded in biologically

                   available to them? This process must involve some inductive
                   biases - factors that affect how a learner generalizes - but
                   it is unclear which inductive biases can explain observed
                   patterns in language acquisition. To facilitate
                   computational modeling aimed at addressing this question, we
                   introduce a framework for giving particular linguistic
                   inductive biases to a neural network model; such a model can
                   then be used to empirically explore the effects of those
                   inductive biases. This framework disentangles universal
                   inductive biases, which are encoded in the initial values of
                   a neural network's parameters, from non-universal factors,
                   which the neural network must learn from data in a given
                   language. The initial state that encodes the inductive
                   biases is found with meta-learning, a technique through
                   which a model discovers how to acquire new languages more
                   easily via exposure to many possible languages. By
                   controlling the properties of the languages that are used
                   during meta-learning, we can control the inductive biases
                   that meta-learning imparts. We demonstrate this framework
                   with a case study based on syllable structure. First, we
                   specify the inductive biases that we intend to give our
                   model, and then we translate those inductive biases into a
                   space of languages from which a model can meta-learn.
                   Finally, using existing analysis techniques, we verify that
                   our approach has imparted the linguistic inductive biases

                   search over programs can be a more effective response to
                   these challenges than purely neural methods. Our framework,

                   higher-order combinators to compose a library of neural
                   functions. Our learning algorithm consists of: (1) a

              direct introspective access to higher order cognitive processes.
              Ss are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that
              importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence
              of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected
              the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report
              on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating
              the effects of a stimulus on a response, they do not do so on the

              extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a
              given response. This suggests that though people may not be able

                   similar manner to scientific reasoning in formal research.
                   Encountering a novel phenomenon, children make hypotheses
                   against data, conduct causal inference from observation,
                   test their theory via experimentation, and correct the
                   proposition if inconsistency arises. Rounds of such
                   processes continue until the underlying mechanism is found.
                   Towards building machines that can learn and think like
                   people, one natural question for us to ask is: whether the
                   intelligence we achieve today manages to perform such a
                   scientific thinking process, and if any, at what level. In
                   this work, we devise the EST environment for evaluating the
                   scientific thinking ability in artificial agents. Motivated
                   by the stream of research on causal discovery, we build our
                   interactive EST environment based on Blicket detection.
                   Specifically, in each episode of EST, an agent is presented
                   with novel observations and asked to figure out all objects'
                   Blicketness. At each time step, the agent proposes new
                   experiments to validate its hypothesis and updates its
                   current belief. By evaluating Reinforcement Learning (RL)
                   agents on both a symbolic and visual version of this task,
                   we notice clear failure of today's learning methods in
                   reaching a level of intelligence comparable to humans. Such
                   inefficacy of learning in scientific thinking calls for

              proposed by adults on children's responses in a dyadic
              picture-book viewing situation. In 2 experiments, adults' use of
              hypotheses (e.g., ``Maybe this is a dwarf's door'') was tested
              against the use of instructive statements (``This is a dwarf's
              door'') and in combination with open questions (``What do you
              think, why is the door so small?''). In Experiment 1, hypotheses
              differed from instructions only by the modal marker ``maybe''.
              Children's responses to hypotheses were longer and contained more
              self-generated explanations as compared to responses to
              instructions. The use of hypotheses also seemed to encourage

              ``experiment'' within the physical world to discover such latent
              properties. In the first part of the paper, we develop a novel
              framework for the quantitative analysis of the information
              produced by physical interactions. We then describe two
              experiments that present participants with moving objects in
              ``microworlds'' that operate according to continuous
              spatiotemporal dynamics similar to everyday physics (i.e., forces
              of gravity, friction, etc.). Participants were asked to interact
              with objects in the microworlds in order to identify their
              masses, or the forces of attraction/repulsion that governed their
              movement. Using our modeling framework, we find that learners who
              freely interacted with the physical system selectively produced
              evidence that revealed the physical property consistent with
              their inquiry goal. As a result, their inferences were more

              yoked participants who watched video replays of an active

              into a range of micro-experiment strategies and discuss how these

              interventions that can discriminate between a learner's
              hypotheses (i.e. possible causal structures). We compare this
              discriminatory model to a positive testing strategy that instead
              aims to confirm individual hypotheses. Experiment 1 shows that
              individual behavior is described best by a mixture of these two
              alternatives. In Experiment 2 we find that people are able to
              adaptively alter their behavior and adopt the discriminatory
              model more often after experiencing that the confirmatory
              strategy leads to a subjective performance decrement. In
              Experiment 3, time pressure leads to the opposite effect of
              inducing a change towards the simpler positive testing strategy.
              These findings suggest that there is no single strategy that
              describes how intervention decisions are made. Instead, people

              type of general physical problem solving, we introduce the

              investigated children's exploratory play after an adult
              pedagogically demonstrated a function of a toy, after an
              interrupted pedagogical demonstration, after a na{\"\i}ve adult
              demonstrated the function, and at baseline. Preschoolers in the
              pedagogical condition focused almost exclusively on the target
              function; by contrast, children in the other conditions explored
              broadly. In Experiment 2, we show that children restrict their
              exploration both after direct instruction to themselves and after
              overhearing direct instruction given to another child; they do
              not show this constraint after observing direct instruction given

              action. We discuss these findings as the result of rational
              inductive biases. In pedagogical contexts, a teacher's failure to
              provide evidence for additional functions provides evidence for
              their absence; such contexts generalize from child to child
              (because children are likely to have comparable states of

              efficient learning but at a cost: children are less likely to

                   represent the physical, non-linguistic world is an open
                   question. Prior work has shown that pretrained LMs can be
                   taught to ``understand'' visual inputs when the models'
                   parameters are updated on image captioning tasks. We test a
                   stronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations
                   learned by text-only models are functionally equivalent (up
                   to a linear transformation) to those learned by models
                   trained on vision tasks. Specifically, we show that the

                   as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only a
                   single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM

                   the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA

                   BEIT (no linguistic information), NF-ResNET (lexical

                   equally well at transferring visual property information to
                   the language model (e.g., whether an animal is large or
                   small), but that image encoders pretrained with linguistic
                   supervision more saliently encode category information
                   (e.g., distinguishing hippo vs.\textbackslash elephant) and
                   thus perform significantly better on benchmark
                   language-and-vision tasks. Our results indicate that LMs

              problem-solving, in addition to solving the problem, people also
              maintain a metacognitive model of their ability to solve the

              aggregation over these simulations. In this paper, we describe

  abstract = "An important part of children's social and cognitive development
              is their understanding that people are psychological beings with
              internal, mental states including desire, intention, perception,
              and belief. A full understanding of people as psychological
              beings requires a representational theory of mind (ToM), which is
              an understanding that mental states can faithfully represent
              reality, or misrepresent reality. For the last 35 years,
              researchers have relied on false-belief tasks as the gold
              standard to test children's understanding that beliefs can
              misrepresent reality. In false-belief tasks, children are asked
              to reason about the behavior of agents who have false beliefs
              about situations. Although a large body of evidence indicates
              that most children pass false-belief tasks by the end of the
              preschool years, the evidence we present in this monograph
              suggests that most children do not understand false beliefs or,
              surprisingly, even true beliefs until middle childhood. We argue
              that young children pass false-belief tasks without understanding
              false beliefs by using perceptual access reasoning (PAR). With
              PAR, children understand that seeing leads to knowing in the
              moment, but not that knowing also arises from thinking or
              persists as memory and belief after the situation changes. By the
              same token, PAR leads children to fail true-belief tasks. PAR
              theory can account for performance on other traditional tests of
              representational ToM and related tasks, and can account for the
              factors that have been found to correlate with or affect both
              true- and false-belief performance. The theory provides a new
              laboratory measure which we label the belief understanding scale
              (BUS). This scale can distinguish between a child who is
              operating with PAR versus a child who is understanding beliefs.
              This scale provides a method needed to allow the study of the
              development of representational ToM. In this monograph, we report
              the outcome of the tests that we have conducted of predictions
              generated by PAR theory. The findings demonstrated signature PAR
              limitations in reasoning about the mind during the ages when
              children are hypothesized to be using PAR. In Chapter II,
              secondary analyses of the published true-belief literature
              revealed that children failed several types of true-belief tasks.
              Chapters III through IX describe new empirical data collected
              across multiple studies between 2003 and 2014 from 580 children
              aged 4-7 years, as well as from a small sample of 14 adults.
              Participants were recruited from the Phoenix, Arizona
              metropolitan area. All participants were native English-speakers.
              Children were recruited from university-sponsored and community
              preschools and daycare centers, and from hospital maternity
              wards. Adults were university students who participated to
              partially fulfill course requirements for research participation.
              Sociometric data were collected only in Chapter IX, and are fully
              reported there. In Chapter III, minor alterations in task
              procedures produced wide variations in children's performance in
              3-option false-belief tasks. In Chapter IV, we report findings
              which show that the developmental lag between children's
              understanding ignorance and understanding false belief is longer
              than the lag reported in previous studies. In Chapter V, children
              did not distinguish between agents who have false beliefs versus
              agents who have no beliefs. In Chapter VI, findings showed that
              children found it no easier to reason about true beliefs than to
              reason about false beliefs. In Chapter VII, when children were
              asked to justify their correct answers in false-belief tasks,
              they did not reference agents' false beliefs. Similarly, in
              Chapter VIII, when children were asked to explain agents' actions
              in false-belief tasks, they did not reference agents' false
              beliefs. In Chapter IX, children who were identified as using PAR
              differed from children who understood beliefs along three
              dimensions-in levels of social development, inhibitory control,
              and kindergarten adjustment. Although the findings need
              replication and additional studies of alternative
              interpretations, the collection of results reported in this
              monograph challenges the prevailing view that representational
              ToM is in place by the end of the preschool years. Furthermore,
              the pattern of findings is consistent with the proposal that PAR
              is the developmental precursor of representational ToM. The
              current findings also raise questions about claims that infants
              and toddlers demonstrate ToM-related abilities, and that
              representational ToM is innate.",

              Our approach solves high-dimensional problems with complex

              manipulate fluid flows and optimizing the shape of an airfoil to

              propagating gradients through trajectories of hundreds of steps,
              even when using models that were pre-trained for single-step
              predictions on data substantially different from the design

              outperformed those found by sampling-based optimization
              techniques. In airfoil design, they matched the quality of those

                   whenever this sample falls inside or on the boundary of the

                   falls outside of that convex hull. One fundamental
                   (mis)conception is that state-of-the-art algorithms work so

              hypothesis ran into difficulties, which led to an alternative

               of the person on the street and the tacit knowledge underlying
               the quantitative knowledge used by engineers and scientists. The
               key to qualitative physics is to find ways to represent
               continuous properties of the world by discrete systems of
               symbols. One can always quantize something continuous, but not
               all quantizations are equally useful. One way to state the idea
               is the relevance principle: The distinctions made by a
               quantization must be relevant to the kind of reasoning
               performed. This chapter describes what qualitative physics is,
               why one should be doing it, and where it came from. It discusses

              verbally. This study investigates the effects of two different
              category properties on learning difficulty in category learning
              tasks-namely, linear separability and variability on stimulus
              dimensions that are irrelevant to the categorization decision.
              Previous research had reported that linearly separable II
              categories are easier to learn than nonlinearly separable
              categories, but Experiment 1, which compared performance on
              linearly and nonlinearly separable categories that were equated
              as closely as possible on all other factors that might affect
              difficulty, found that linear separability had no effect on
              learning. Experiments 1 and 2 together also established a novel
              dissociation between RB and II category learning: increasing
              variability on irrelevant stimulus dimensions impaired II
              learning but not RB learning. These results are all predicted by

              the theory that cognition is embodied. Like all good ideas in
              cognitive science, however, embodiment immediately came to mean
              six different things. The most common definitions involve the
              straight-forward claim that ``states of the body modify states of
              the mind.'' However, the implications of embodiment are actually
              much more radical than this. If cognition can span the brain,
              body, and the environment, then the ``states of mind'' of
              disembodied cognitive science won't exist to be modified.
              Cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a
              broad array of resources. Taking embodiment seriously therefore
              requires both new methods and theory. Here we outline four key
              steps that research programs should follow in order to fully
              engage with the implications of embodiment. The first step is to
              conduct a task analysis, which characterizes from a first person
              perspective the specific task that a perceiving-acting cognitive
              agent is faced with. The second step is to identify the
              task-relevant resources the agent has access to in order to solve
              the task. These resources can span brain, body, and environment.
              The third step is to identify how the agent can assemble these
              resources into a system capable of solving the problem at hand.
              The last step is to test the agent's performance to confirm that
              agent is actually using the solution identified in step 3. We
              explore these steps in more detail with reference to two useful
              examples (the outfielder problem and the A-not-B error), and
              introduce how to apply this analysis to the thorny question of
              language use. Embodied cognition is more than we think it is, and
              we have the tools we need to realize its full potential.",

  abstract  = "Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the
               question of how to represent time in connectionist models is
               very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by
               its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a
               spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal
               along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which
               involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks
               with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns
               are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which
               develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior
               internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range
               from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to
               discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks
               are able to learn interesting internal representations which
               incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this
               approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task
               processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which
               allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing
               generalizations across classes of items. These representations

               physical objects and choosing actions accordingly to accomplish
               tasks, while this remains a major challenge for artificial
               intelligence. To facilitate research addressing this problem, we
               propose a new testbed that requires an agent to reason about
               physical scenarios and take an action appropriately. Inspired by
               the physical knowledge acquired in infancy and the capabilities
               required for robots to operate in real-world environments, we
               identify 15 essential physical scenarios. We create a wide
               variety of distinct task templates, and we ensure that all the
               task templates within the same scenario can be solved by using
               one specific strategic physical rule. By having such a design,
               we evaluate two distinct levels of generalization, namely local
               generalization and broad generalization. We conduct an extensive
               evaluation with human players, learning agents with various
               input types and architectures, and heuristic agents with
               different strategies. Inspired by how the human intelligence
               quotient is calculated, we define the physical reasoning
               quotient (Phy-Q score) that reflects the physical reasoning
               intelligence of an agent using the physical scenarios we
               considered. Our evaluation shows that (1) all the agents are far
               below human performance, and (2) learning agents, even with good
               local generalization ability, struggle to learn the underlying
               physical reasoning rules and fail to generalize broadly. We
               encourage the development of intelligent agents that can reach
               the human-level Phy-Q score. When it comes to reasoning about
               the motion of physical objects, humans have natural intuitive
               physics knowledge. To test how good artificial learning agents
               are in similar predictive abilities, Xue and colleagues present

                   they interact with one another. To partition images into
                   entities, deep-learning researchers have proposed structural
                   inductive biases such as slot-based architectures. To model
                   interactions among entities, equivariant graph neural nets
                   (GNNs) are used, but these are not particularly well suited
                   to the task for two reasons. First, GNNs do not predispose
                   interactions to be sparse, as relationships among
                   independent entities are likely to be. Second, GNNs do not

                   inspiration from cognitive science and resurrect a classic
                   approach, production systems, which consist of a set of rule
                   templates that are applied by binding placeholder variables

              multi-player experiments asking participants to teach concepts
              using either demonstrations or language. Our first experiment
              (N=416) asks when language might outperform demonstration. We
              manipulate the complexity of the concept being taught and find
              that language communicates complex concepts more effectively than
              demonstration. We then ask why language succeeds in this setting.
              We hypothesized that language allowed teachers to reference
              abstract object features (e.g., shapes and colors), while
              demonstration teachers could only provide concrete examples

              our second experiment (N=568) ablated object features from the

              linguistic (but not demonstrative) teaching. Our findings suggest
              that language communicates complex concepts by directly

              examples, requiring the learner to infer the rules.",

                   is naturally rich, covering ~4x more interaction space than
                   task demonstrations for the same amount of collection time.
                   To learn control from play, we introduce Play-LMP, a
                   self-supervised method that learns to organize play
                   behaviors in a latent space, then reuse them at test time to
                   achieve specific goals. Combining self-supervised control
                   with a diverse play dataset shifts the focus of skill
                   learning from a narrow and discrete set of tasks to the full
                   continuum of behaviors available in an environment. We find
                   that this combination generalizes well empirically---after
                   self-supervising on unlabeled play, our method substantially
                   outperforms individual expert-trained policies on 18
                   difficult user-specified visual manipulation tasks in a
                   simulated robotic tabletop environment. We additionally find
                   that play-supervised models, unlike their expert-trained
                   counterparts, are more robust to perturbations and exhibit
                   retrying-till-success behaviors. Finally, we find that our
                   agent organizes its latent plan space around functional
                   tasks, despite never being trained with task labels. Videos,

              representational change are described: the relaxation of
              constraints on the solution and the decomposition of perceptual
              chunks. These 2 mechanisms generate specific predictions about
              the relative difficulty of individual problems and about
              differential transfer effects. The predictions were tested in 4

              defined over two dimensions and then classified test items in
              distant transfer regions of the category space. The paradigm
              yielded results that challenged the predictions from both

              LDT, and others on salient logical rules---provides an

              considerably worse than does this LDT-exemplar-rule mixture

  abstract = "The insightful problem-solving process has been proposed to
              involve three main phases: an initial representation phase, in
              which the solver inappropriately represents the problem; an
              initial search through the faulty problem space that may lead to
              impasse; and a postimpasse restructuring phase. Some theories
              propose that the restructuring phase involves controlled search
              processes, whereas other theories propose that restructuring is
              achieved through the automatic redistribution of activation in
              long-term memory. In this study, we used correlations between
              working memory (WM) span measures and problem-solving success to
              test the predictions of these different theories. One group of
              participants received a set of insight problems that allowed for
              a large initial faulty search space, whereas another group
              received a matched set that constrained the initial faulty search
              space in order to isolate the restructuring phase of the
              insightful process. The results suggest that increased ability to
              control attention (as measured by WM span tasks) predicts an
              individual's ability to successfully solve problems that involve
              both the initial search phase and the restructuring phase.
              However, individual differences in ability to control attention
              do not predict success on problems that isolate the restructuring
              phase. These results are interpreted as supporting an

              to see how to solve a problem and then--``aha!''--there is a
              sudden realization how to solve it. Two contemporary theories
              have been proposed to explain insight. The representational
              change theory (e.g., G. Knoblich, S. Ohlsson, \& G. E. Rainey,
              2001) proposes that insight occurs through relaxing self-imposed
              constraints on a problem and by decomposing chunked items in the
              problem. The progress monitoring theory (e.g., J. N. MacGregor,
              T. C. Ormerod, \& E. P. Chronicle, 2001) proposes that insight is
              only sought once it becomes apparent that the distance to the
              goal is unachievable in the moves remaining. These 2 theories are
              tested in an unlimited move problem, to which neither theory has
              previously been applied. The results lend support to both, but
              experimental manipulations to the problem suggest that the
              representational change theory is the better indicator of
              performance. The findings suggest that testable opposing
              predictions can be made to examine theories of insight and that

  abstract = "The disambiguation of a syntactically ambiguous sentence in favor
              of a less preferred parse can lead to slower reading at the
              disambiguation point. This phenomenon, referred to as a
              garden-path effect, has motivated models in which readers
              initially maintain only a subset of the possible parses of the
              sentence, and subsequently require time-consuming reanalysis to
              reconstruct a discarded parse. A more recent proposal argues that
              the garden-path effect can be reduced to surprisal arising in a
              fully parallel parser: words consistent with the initially
              dispreferred but ultimately correct parse are simply less
              predictable than those consistent with the incorrect parse. Since
              predictability has pervasive effects in reading far beyond
              garden-path sentences, this account, which dispenses with
              reanalysis mechanisms, is more parsimonious. Crucially, it
              predicts a linear effect of surprisal: the garden-path effect is
              expected to be proportional to the difference in word surprisal
              between the ultimately correct and ultimately incorrect
              interpretations. To test this prediction, we used recurrent
              neural network language models to estimate word-by-word surprisal
              for three temporarily ambiguous constructions. We then estimated
              the slowdown attributed to each bit of surprisal from human
              self-paced reading times, and used that quantity to predict
              syntactic disambiguation difficulty. Surprisal successfully
              predicted the existence of garden-path effects, but drastically
              underpredicted their magnitude, and failed to predict their
              relative severity across constructions. We conclude that a full

              recovery mechanisms beyond predictability.",

                   when the structure is disambiguated in favor of the less
                   preferred alternative. Surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy,
                   2008), a prominent explanation of this finding, proposes
                   that these slowdowns are due to the unpredictability of each
                   of the words that occur in these sentences. Challenging this
                   hypothesis, van Schijndel \& Linzen (2021) find that
                   estimates of the cost of word predictability derived from

                   human garden path effects. In this work, we consider whether
                   this underestimation is due to the fact that humans weight
                   syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than
                   language models do. We propose a method for estimating
                   syntactic predictability from a language model, allowing us
                   to weigh the cost of lexical and syntactic predictability

                   predictability independently from lexical predictability
                   indeed results in larger estimates of garden path. At the
                   same time, even when syntactic predictability is
                   independently weighted, surprisal still greatly
                   underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects.
                   Our results support the hypothesis that predictability is
                   not the only factor responsible for the processing cost

  abstract = "The dominant paradigm of experiments in the social and behavioral
              sciences views an experiment as a test of a theory, where the
              theory is assumed to generalize beyond the experiment's specific
              conditions. According to this view, which Alan Newell once
              characterized as ``playing twenty questions with nature,'' theory
              is advanced one experiment at a time, and the integration of
              disparate findings is assumed to happen via the scientific
              publishing process. In this article, we argue that the process of
              integration is at best inefficient, and at worst it does not, in
              fact, occur. We further show that the challenge of integration
              cannot be adequately addressed by recently proposed reforms that
              focus on the reliability and replicability of individual
              findings, nor simply by conducting more or larger experiments.
              Rather, the problem arises from the imprecise nature of social
              and behavioral theories and, consequently, a lack of
              commensurability across experiments conducted under different
              conditions. Therefore, researchers must fundamentally rethink how
              they design experiments and how the experiments relate to theory.
              We specifically describe an alternative framework, integrative
              experiment design, which intrinsically promotes commensurability
              and continuous integration of knowledge. In this paradigm,
              researchers explicitly map the design space of possible
              experiments associated with a given research question, embracing
              many potentially relevant theories rather than focusing on just
              one. The researchers then iteratively generate theories and test
              them with experiments explicitly sampled from the design space,
              allowing results to be integrated across experiments. Given
              recent methodological and technological developments, we conclude
              that this approach is feasible and would generate more-reliable,
              more-cumulative empirical and theoretical knowledge than the

               that ``Aha!'' moment, when sudden clarity emerges from a tangled
               web of thoughts and ideas? This research integrates
               psychological work on insight with graph theoretic work on
               ``small-world'' phenomenon, to construct a theory that explains
               how insight occurs, how it is similar to and different from more
               typical learning processes, and why it yields an affective
               response in the individual. I propose that cognitive insight
               occurs when an atypical association, forged through random
               recombination or directed search, results in a ``shortcut'' in
               an individual's network of representations. This causes a rapid

               understanding of the relationships within and among the affected
               representations, and can prompt a cascade of other connections.

              hallmark of human linguistic abilities. However, its underlying
              neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. We studied whether a
              modern artificial neural network trained with ``deep learning''
              methods mimics a central aspect of human sentence processing,
              namely the storing of grammatical number and gender information
              in working memory and its use in long-distance agreement (e.g.,
              capturing the correct number agreement between subject and verb
              when they are separated by other phrases). Although the network,
              a recurrent architecture with Long Short-Term Memory units, was
              solely trained to predict the next word in a large corpus,
              analysis showed the emergence of a very sparse set of specialized
              units that successfully handled local and long-distance syntactic
              agreement for grammatical number. However, the simulations also
              showed that this mechanism does not support full recursion and
              fails with some long-range embedded dependencies. We tested the
              model's predictions in a behavioral experiment where humans
              detected violations in number agreement in sentences with
              systematic variations in the singular/plural status of multiple
              nouns, with or without embedding. Human and model error patterns
              were remarkably similar, showing that the model echoes various
              effects observed in human data. However, a key difference was
              that, with embedded long-range dependencies, humans remained
              above chance level, while the model's systematic errors brought
              it below chance. Overall, our study shows that exploring the ways
              in which modern artificial neural networks process sentences
              leads to precise and testable hypotheses about human linguistic
              performance.",

  abstract      = "How should we compare the capabilities of language models
                   and humans? Here, I consider a case study: processing of
                   recursively nested grammatical structures. Prior work has
                   suggested that language models cannot handle these
                   structures as reliably as humans can. However, the humans
                   were provided with instructions and training before being
                   evaluated, while the language models were evaluated
                   zero-shot. I therefore attempt to more closely match the
                   evaluation paradigms by providing language models with
                   few-shot prompts. A simple prompt, which contains
                   substantially less content than the human training, allows
                   large language models to consistently outperform the human
                   results. The same prompt even allows extrapolation to more
                   deeply nested conditions than have been tested in humans.
                   Further, a reanalysis of the prior human experiments
                   suggests that the humans may not perform above chance at the
                   difficult structures initially. These results suggest that
                   large language models can in fact process recursively nested
                   grammatical structures comparably to humans. This case study
                   highlights how discrepancies in the quantity of
                   experiment-specific context can confound comparisons of
                   language models and humans. I use this case study to reflect
                   on the broader challenge of comparing human and model
                   capabilities, and to suggest that there is an important
                   difference between evaluating cognitive models of a specific
                   phenomenon and evaluating broadly-trained models.",

               connectionist models of unsupervised learning and some older

               sensory pathways (Barlow 1959), and pattern recognition

               observations of mean, variance, and covariance of sensory
               messages, and perhaps also by a method called ``minimum entropy
               coding.'' (3) Such knowledge may be incorporated in a model of
               ``what usually happens'' with which incoming messages are
               automatically compared, enabling unexpected discrepancies to be
               immediately identified. (4) Knowledge of the sort incorporated

              people successfully plan solutions to many everyday problems
              despite having limited cognitive resources1-3. Standard accounts
              in psychology, economics and artificial intelligence have

              even predict human brain activity-raising the exciting
              possibility that such systems represent the world like we do.
              However, even seemingly intelligent machines fail in strange and
              ``unhumanlike'' ways, threatening their status as models of our
              minds. How can we know when human-machine behavioral differences
              reflect deep disparities in their underlying capacities, vs. when
              such failures are only superficial or peripheral? This article
              draws on a foundational insight from cognitive science-the
              distinction between performance and competence-to encourage
              ``species-fair'' comparisons between humans and machines. The
              performance/competence distinction urges us to consider whether
              the failure of a system to behave as ideally hypothesized, or the
              failure of one creature to behave like another, arises not
              because the system lacks the relevant knowledge or internal
              capacities (``competence''), but instead because of superficial
              constraints on demonstrating that knowledge (``performance''). I
              argue that this distinction has been neglected by research
              comparing human and machine behavior, and that it should be
              essential to any such comparison. Focusing on the domain of image
              classification, I identify three factors contributing to the
              species-fairness of human-machine comparisons, extracted from
              recent work that equates such constraints. Species-fair
              comparisons level the playing field between natural and
              artificial intelligence, so that we can separate more superficial
              differences from those that may be deep and enduring.",

              reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling

                   In a vast space of held-out environment dynamics, our
                   adaptive agent (AdA) displays on-the-fly hypothesis-driven

                   (1) meta-reinforcement learning across a vast, smooth and

              variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures

                   However, inducing language model rationale generation
                   currently requires either constructing massive rationale
                   datasets or sacrificing accuracy by using only few-shot

                   without rationales, to bootstrap the ability to perform
                   successively more complex reasoning. This technique, the
                   ``Self-Taught Reasoner'' (STaR), relies on a simple loop:
                   generate rationales to answer many questions, prompted with
                   a few rationale examples; if the generated answers are
                   wrong, try again to generate a rationale given the correct
                   answer; fine-tune on all the rationales that ultimately
                   yielded correct answers; repeat. We show that STaR
                   significantly improves performance on multiple datasets
                   compared to a model fine-tuned to directly predict final
                   answers, and performs comparably to fine-tuning a 30$\times$
                   larger state-of-the-art language model on CommensenseQA.
                   Thus, STaR lets a model improve itself by learning from its

                   agents to learn abstract, text based policies in TextWorld
                   (C\textbackslash^ot\textbackslash'e et al., 2018) and then
                   execute goals from the ALFRED benchmark (Shridhar et al.,
                   2020) in a rich visual environment. ALFWorld enables the
                   creation of a new BUTLER agent whose abstract knowledge,
                   learned in TextWorld, corresponds directly to concrete,
                   visually grounded actions. In turn, as we demonstrate
                   empirically, this fosters better agent generalization than
                   training only in the visually grounded environment. BUTLER's
                   simple, modular design factors the problem to allow
                   researchers to focus on models for improving every piece of
                   the pipeline (language understanding, planning, navigation,
                   and visual scene understanding).",

                   tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially
                   complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists
                   in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs
                   can leverage these augmentations separately or in
                   combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from
                   demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens
                   prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various,
                   possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their

              interacts with many other cognitive processes such as

              analysis, and synthesis on the basis of internal knowledge
              representation by the object--attribute-relation (OAR) model.
              Problem solving is a cognitive process of the brain that searches
              a solution for a given problem or finds a path to reach a given
              goal. When a problem object is identified, problem solving can be
              perceived as a search process in the memory space for finding a
              relationship between a set of solution goals and a set of
              alternative paths. This paper presents both a cognitive model and
              a mathematical model of the problem solving process. The
              cognitive structures of the brain and the mechanisms of internal
              knowledge representation behind the cognitive process of problem

              between the opposing demands of gathering and exploiting
              information. In a classic illustration of this
              'exploration-exploitation' dilemma, a gambler choosing between
              multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems,
              on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option,
              against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might
              turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide information for
              improving future decisions). Far from representing idle
              curiosity, such exploration is often critical for organisms to
              discover how best to harvest resources such as food and water. In
              appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned
              by computational reinforcement learning (RL) theory, indicates
              that a dopaminergic, striatal and medial prefrontal network
              mediates learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration
              has been well studied from both theoretical and ethological
              perspectives, its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we
              show, in a gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be
              characterized by a computationally well-regarded strategy for
              addressing the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this
              characterization to classify decisions as exploratory or
              exploitative, we employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to
              show that the frontopolar cortex and intraparietal sulcus are

              regions of striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit
              activity characteristic of an involvement in value-based
              exploitative decision making. The results suggest a model of
              action selection under uncertainty that involves switching
              between exploratory and exploitative behavioural modes, and
              provide a computationally precise characterization of the

               supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction
               problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and
               less peak computation than conventional methods and they produce
               more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which
               supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction
               problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be
               applied to advantage.",

  abstract      = "The aim of this paper is to introduce a new learning
                   procedure for neural networks and to demonstrate that it
                   works well enough on a few small problems to be worth
                   further investigation. The Forward-Forward algorithm
                   replaces the forward and backward passes of backpropagation
                   by two forward passes, one with positive (i.e. real) data
                   and the other with negative data which could be generated by
                   the network itself. Each layer has its own objective
                   function which is simply to have high goodness for positive
                   data and low goodness for negative data. The sum of the
                   squared activities in a layer can be used as the goodness
                   but there are many other possibilities, including minus the
                   sum of the squared activities. If the positive and negative
                   passes could be separated in time, the negative passes could
                   be done offline, which would make the learning much simpler
                   in the positive pass and allow video to be pipelined through
                   the network without ever storing activities or stopping to
                   propagate derivatives.",

  author   = "Batchelder, William H and Alexander, Gregory E",
  abstract = "This paper provides a critical examination of the current state
              and future possibility of formal cognitive theory for insight
              problem solving and its associated ``aha!'' experience. Insight
              problems are contrasted with move problems, which have been
              formally defined and studied extensively by cognitive
              psychologists since the pioneering work of Alan Newell and
              Herbert Simon. To facilitate our discussion, a number of
              classical brainteasers are presented along with their solutions
              and some conclusions derived from observing the behavior of many
              students trying to solve them. Some of these problems are
              interesting in their own right, and many of them have not been
              discussed before in the psychological literature. The main
              purpose of presenting the brainteasers is to assist in discussing
              the status of formal cognitive theory for insight problem
              solving, which is argued to be considerably weaker than that
              found in other areas of higher cognition such as human memory,
              decision-making, categorization, and perception. We discuss
              theoretical barriers that have plagued the development of
              successful formal theory for insight problem solving. A few
              suggestions are made that might serve to advance the field.",
