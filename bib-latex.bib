              broader range of disciplines making important contributions. In
              this volume, leading philosophers and cognitive scientists offer
              original essays that present the state-of-the-art in the study of
              concepts. These essays, all commissioned for this book, do not
              merely present the usual surveys and overviews; rather, they
              offer the latest work on concepts by a diverse group of theorists
              as well as discussions of the ideas that should guide research
              over the next decade. The book is an essential companion volume
              to the earlier Concepts: Core Readings, the definitive source for
              classic texts on the nature of concepts. The essays cover
              concepts as they relate to animal cognition, the brain,

                   available to them? This process must involve some inductive
                   biases - factors that affect how a learner generalizes - but
                   it is unclear which inductive biases can explain observed
                   patterns in language acquisition. To facilitate
                   computational modeling aimed at addressing this question, we
                   introduce a framework for giving particular linguistic
                   inductive biases to a neural network model; such a model can
                   then be used to empirically explore the effects of those
                   inductive biases. This framework disentangles universal
                   inductive biases, which are encoded in the initial values of
                   a neural network's parameters, from non-universal factors,
                   which the neural network must learn from data in a given
                   language. The initial state that encodes the inductive
                   biases is found with meta-learning, a technique through
                   which a model discovers how to acquire new languages more
                   easily via exposure to many possible languages. By
                   controlling the properties of the languages that are used
                   during meta-learning, we can control the inductive biases
                   that meta-learning imparts. We demonstrate this framework
                   with a case study based on syllable structure. First, we
                   specify the inductive biases that we intend to give our
                   model, and then we translate those inductive biases into a
                   space of languages from which a model can meta-learn.
                   Finally, using existing analysis techniques, we verify that
                   our approach has imparted the linguistic inductive biases

                   higher-order combinators to compose a library of neural
                   functions. Our learning algorithm consists of: (1) a
                   symbolic program synthesizer that performs a type-directed
                   search over parameterized programs, and decides on the

              direct introspective access to higher order cognitive processes.
              Ss are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that
              importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence
              of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected
              the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report
              on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating
              the effects of a stimulus on a response, they do not do so on the
              basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based
              on a priori, implicit causal theories, or judgments about the
              extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a
              given response. This suggests that though people may not be able

              sometimes be able to report accurately about them. Accurate

  abstract = "Adult-child interactions can support children's development and

              proposed by adults on children's responses in a dyadic
              picture-book viewing situation. In 2 experiments, adults' use of
              hypotheses (e.g., ``Maybe this is a dwarf's door'') was tested
              against the use of instructive statements (``This is a dwarf's
              door'') and in combination with open questions (``What do you
              think, why is the door so small?''). In Experiment 1, hypotheses
              differed from instructions only by the modal marker ``maybe''.
              Children's responses to hypotheses were longer and contained more
              self-generated explanations as compared to responses to
              instructions. The use of hypotheses also seemed to encourage

              ``experiment'' within the physical world to discover such latent

              framework for the quantitative analysis of the information
              produced by physical interactions. We then describe two
              experiments that present participants with moving objects in
              ``microworlds'' that operate according to continuous
              spatiotemporal dynamics similar to everyday physics (i.e., forces
              of gravity, friction, etc.). Participants were asked to interact
              with objects in the microworlds in order to identify their
              masses, or the forces of attraction/repulsion that governed their
              movement. Using our modeling framework, we find that learners who
              freely interacted with the physical system selectively produced
              evidence that revealed the physical property consistent with
              their inquiry goal. As a result, their inferences were more

              interventions that can discriminate between a learner's
              hypotheses (i.e. possible causal structures). We compare this

              aims to confirm individual hypotheses. Experiment 1 shows that
              individual behavior is described best by a mixture of these two

              adaptively alter their behavior and adopt the discriminatory

              this type of general physical problem solving, we introduce the

  abstract = "Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
              trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict
              cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the
              internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and
              the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we
              develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into
              the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We
              focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a
              scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a
              previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the
              OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of
              scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move
              within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this
              affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely
              feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep
              CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously
              trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the
              CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in
              the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA
              variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The
              CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of
              affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of
              in silico experiments on this model to gain insights into its
              internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation
              of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual
              information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal
              orientations, both of which have previously been identified as
              lowlevel stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex.
              These computations also exhibited a strong preference for
              information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with
              known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature
              selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based
              responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial
              environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large
              extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory
              functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that
              provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly,

              representations onto voxel-wise fMRI responses during object
              viewing. We found that cortical responses to single objects were
              predicted by the statistical ensembles in which they typically
              occur, and that this link between objects and their visual

               human-like artificial systems, we need to be following an
               appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define and
               evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons between
               two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the past
               hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define
               and measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology
               and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions and
               evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical
               conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We
               note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still
               gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the
               skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks, such as
               board games and video games. We argue that solely measuring
               skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence,
               because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and
               experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow
               experimenters to ``buy'' arbitrary levels of skills for a
               system, in a way that masks the system's own generalization
               power. We then articulate a new formal definition of
               intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing
               intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting
               the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and
               experience, as critical pieces to be accounted for in
               characterizing intelligent systems. Using this definition, we
               propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark
               should look like. Finally, we present a new benchmark closely
               following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus
               (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be as
               close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC can
               be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid
               intelligence and that it enables fair general intelligence
               comparisons between AI systems and humans.",

              process that produces symbols with transition from state to state
              can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular
              subclass of such processes that producen-order statistical
              approximations to English do not come closer, with increasingn,
              to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the

              approaches fall well short of these human standards, although
              different modeling traditions often have complementary strengths.
              Symbolic models can capture the compositional and causal
              knowledge that enables flexible generalization, but they struggle
              to learn from raw inputs, relying on strong abstractions and
              simplifying assumptions. Neural network models can learn directly
              from raw data, but they struggle to capture compositional and
              causal structure and typically must retrain to tackle new tasks.
              We bring together these two traditions to learn generative models
              of concepts that capture rich compositional and causal structure,
              while learning from raw data. We develop a generative
              neuro-symbolic (GNS) model of handwritten character concepts that
              uses the control flow of a probabilistic program, coupled with
              symbolic stroke primitives and a symbolic image renderer, to
              represent the causal and compositional processes by which
              characters are formed. The distributions of parts (strokes), and
              correlations between parts, are modeled with neural network
              subroutines, allowing the model to learn directly from raw data
              and express nonparametric statistical relationships. We apply our
              model to the Omniglot challenge of human-level concept learning,
              using a background set of alphabets to learn an expressive prior
              distribution over character drawings. In a subsequent evaluation,
              our GNS model uses probabilistic inference to learn rich
              conceptual representations from a single training image that

              for cognitive architecture and the sorts of models that have
              traditionally been assumed in cognitive science. We claim that
              the major distinction is that, while both Connectionist and
              Classical architectures postulate representational mental states,
              the latter but not the former are committed to a symbol-level of
              representation, or to a `language of thought': i.e., to
              representational states that have combinatorial syntactic and
              semantic structure. Several arguments for combinatorial structure
              in mental representations are then reviewed. These include
              arguments based on the `systematicity' of mental representation:
              i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit
              certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given
              thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with
              semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make
              a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist
              at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that
              Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or `abstract
              neurological') structures in which Classical cognitive
              architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard
              arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and
              conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation.

               Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to
               reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a
               prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new
               theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural
               networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep

               tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting
               information from existing models that has been thrown away so
               far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in
               deep learning without sacrificing either computational

              localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data

               predict the behavior of complex systems like brains, and
               substantial computation might be needed to simulate human-like

              generalization, which extends far beyond our direct experiences.
              In this paper, we argue that the underlying cause for this
              shortcoming is their inability to dynamically and flexibly bind
              information that is distributed throughout the network. This
              binding problem affects their capacity to acquire a compositional
              understanding of the world in terms of symbol-like entities (like
              objects), which is crucial for generalizing in predictable and
              systematic ways. To address this issue, we propose a unifying
              framework that revolves around forming meaningful entities from
              unstructured sensory inputs (segregation), maintaining this
              separation of information at a representational level
              (representation), and using these entities to construct new
              inferences, predictions, and behaviors (composition). Our
              analysis draws inspiration from a wealth of research in
              neuroscience and cognitive psychology, and surveys relevant
              mechanisms from the machine learning literature, to help identify
              a combination of inductive biases that allow symbolic information
              processing to emerge naturally in neural networks. We believe
              that a compositional approach to AI, in terms of grounded
              symbol-like representations, is of fundamental importance for
              realizing human-level generalization, and we hope that this paper

              been influenced by a range of direct and indirect selection
              pressures for both cognitive and non-cognitive functions and
              capabilities. It has been hypothesized that hominin brain
              expansion was, in part, a correlated response to selection acting
              on aerobic capacity (Raichlen \& Polk, 2013). According to this
              hypothesis, selection for aerobic capacity increased the activity
              of various signaling molecules, including those involved in brain
              growth. One key molecule is brain-derived neurotrophic factor
              (BDNF), a protein that regulates neuronal development, survival,
              and plasticity in mammals. This review updates, partially tests,
              and expands Raichlen and Polk's (2013) hypothesis by evaluating
              evidence for BDNF as a mediator of brain size. Discussion We
              contend that selection for endurance capabilities in a hot
              climate favored changes to muscle composition, mitochondrial
              dynamics and increased energy budget through pathways involving
              regulation of PGC-1$\alpha$ and MEF2 genes, both of which promote
              BDNF activity. In addition, the evolution of hairlessness and the
              skin's thermoregulatory response provide other molecular pathways
              that promote both BDNF activity and neurotransmitter synthesis.
              We discuss how these pathways contributed to the evolution of
              brain size and function in human evolution and propose avenues
              for future research. Our results support Raichlen and Polk's

              mechanistic linkages to the evolution of brain size in hominins.",

               sessions in a counterbalanced order on separate days. The
               exercise sessions consisted of 5 min of warm up exercises
               followed by 30 min of running or badminton. The exercise
               intensity was set at 60\% ($\pm$5\%) of the heart rate reserve

              form could be a tree, ring, chain, grid, etc. (Kemp \& Tenenbaum,

              the ability of DNNs to learn useful representations of

              We examine the relationship between the representations learned

  abstract = "Each of our theories of mental representation provides some
              insight into how the mind works. However, these insights often
              seem incompatible, as the debates between symbolic, dynamical,
              emergentist, sub-symbolic, and grounded approaches to cognition
              attest. Mental representations---whatever they are---must share
              many features with each of our theories of representation, and
              yet there are few hypotheses about how a synthesis could be
              possible. Here, I develop a theory of the underpinnings of
              symbolic cognition that shows how sub-symbolic dynamics may give
              rise to higher-level cognitive representations of structures,
              systems of knowledge, and algorithmic processes. This theory
              implements a version of conceptual role semantics by positing an
              internal universal representation language in which learners may
              create mental models to capture dynamics they observe in the
              world. The theory formalizes one account of how truly novel
              conceptual content may arise, allowing us to explain how even
              elementary logical and computational operations may be learned
              from a more primitive basis. I provide an implementation that
              learns to represent a variety of structures, including logic,
              number, kinship trees, regular languages, context-free languages,
              domains of theories like magnetism, dominance hierarchies, list
              structures, quantification, and computational primitives like
              repetition, reversal, and recursion. This account is based on
              simple discrete dynamical processes that could be implemented in
              a variety of different physical or biological systems. In
              particular, I describe how the required dynamics can be directly

              provides an ``assembly language'' for cognition, where high-level
              theories of symbolic computation can be implemented in simple

              interpret the object as intentional and assign to it the unique
              properties of the psychological domain. The key property tested
              was: Do infants attribute value to interactions between
              intentional objects using criteria specified by the model?We
              showed infants (average age 52 weeks) computer-generated
              animations of spontaneously moving ``balls,'' using looking time

               improve health. Thus, understanding the molecular factors that

               imperative for the development of strategies to reduce sedentary
               behavior and in turn prevent chronic disease. Despite many of

               that may influence this complex behavior. The mesolimbic
               dopamine system regulates motivating and rewarding behavior as
               well as motor movement. Here, we present data supporting the

               so, we review data that suggests mesolimbic dopamine activity is
               a strong contributor to voluntary physical activity behavior. We
               also summarize findings suggesting that obesity leads to central
               dopaminergic dysfunction, which in turn contributes to
               reductions in physical activity that often accompany obesity.
               Additionally, we highlight examples in which central leptin
               activity influences physical activity levels in a
               dopamine-dependent manner. Future elucidation of these

                 change from 20th-century to 21st-century AI, and how can
                 remaining limitations of current AI be overcome? Until now,
                 the widely accepted narrative has attributed the recent
                 progress in AI to technical engineering advances that have
                 yielded massive increases in the quantity of computational
                 resources and training data available to support statistical
                 learning in deep artificial neural networks. Although these
                 quantitative engineering innovations are important, here we
                 show that the latest advances in AI are not solely due to
                 quantitative increases in computing power but also qualitative
                 changes in how that computing power is deployed. These
                 qualitative changes have brought about a new type of computing
                 that we call neurocompositional computing. In
                 neurocompositional computing, neural networks exploit two
                 scientific principles that contemporary theory in cognitive
                 science maintains are simultaneously necessary to enable
                 human-level cognition. The Compositionality Principle asserts
                 that encodings of complex information are structures that are
                 systematically composed from simpler structured encodings. The
                 Continuity Principle states that the encoding and processing
                 of information is formalized with real numbers that vary
                 continuously. These principles have seemed irreconcilable
                 until the recent mathematical discovery that compositionality
                 can be realized not only through the traditional discrete
                 methods of symbolic computing, well developed in 20th-century
                 AI, but also through novel forms of continuous neural
                 computing---neurocompositional computing. The unprecedented
                 progress of 21st-century AI has resulted from the use of
                 limited---first-generation---forms of neurocompositional
                 computing. We show that the new techniques now being deployed
                 in second-generation neurocompositional computing create AI
                 systems that are not only more robust and accurate than
                 current systems, but also more comprehensible---making it
                 possible to diagnose errors in, and exert human control over,
                 artificial neural networks through interpretation of their
                 internal states and direct intervention upon those states.

  abstract = "While neural net models have been developed to a high degree of
              sophistication, they have some drawbacks at a more integrative,
              ``architectural'' level of analysis. We describe a ``hybrid''
              cognitive architecture that is implementable in neuronal nets,
              and which has uniform brainlike features, including
              activation-passing and highly distributed ``codelets,''
              implementable as small-scale neural nets. Empirically, this
              cognitive architecture accounts qualitatively for the data
              described by Baars' Global Workspace Theory (GWT), and Franklin's
              LIDA architecture, including state-of-the-art models of conscious

              workability, autonomous agency, a plausible role for conscious
              cognition, and translatability into plausible neural terms. It
