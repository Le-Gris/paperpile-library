  abstract = "Experience exerts a profound influence on the brain and,
              therefore, on behavior. When the effect of experience on the brain
              is particularly strong during a limited period in development,
              this period is referred to as a sensitive period. Such periods
              allow experience to instruct neural circuits to process or
              represent information in a way that is adaptive for the
              individual. When experience provides information that is essential
              for normal development and alters performance permanently, such
              sensitive periods are referred to as critical periods. Although
              sensitive periods are reflected in behavior, they are actually a
              property of neural circuits. Mechanisms of plasticity at the
              circuit level are discussed that have been shown to operate during
              sensitive periods. A hypothesis is proposed that experience during
              a sensitive period modifies the architecture of a circuit in
              fundamental ways, causing certain patterns of connectivity to
              become highly stable and, therefore, energetically preferred.
              Plasticity that occurs beyond the end of a sensitive period, which
              is substantial in many circuits, alters connectivity patterns
              within the architectural constraints established during the
              sensitive period. Preferences in a circuit that result from
              experience during sensitive periods are illustrated graphically as
              changes in a ''stability landscape,'' a metaphor that represents
              the relative contributions of genetic and experiential influences
              in shaping the information processing capabilities of a neural
              circuit. By understanding sensitive periods at the circuit level,
              as well as understanding the relationship between circuit
              properties and behavior, we gain a deeper insight into the
              critical role that experience plays in shaping the development of
              the brain and behavior.",

               overactive reward system in the brain. Longitudinal studies are
               pivotal for testing these brain-behavior relations because
               individual slopes are more sensitive for detecting change. The
               aim of the current study was twofold: (1) to test patterns of
               age-related change (i.e., linear, quadratic, and cubic) in
               activity in the nucleus accumbens, a key reward region in the
               brain, in relation to change in puberty (self-report and
               testosterone levels), laboratory risk-taking and self-reported
               risk-taking tendency; and (2) to test whether individual
               differences in pubertal development and risk-taking behavior were
               contributors to longitudinal change in nucleus accumbens
               activity. We included 299 human participants at the first time
               point and 254 participants at the second time point, ranging
               between ages 8–27 years, time points were separated by a 2 year
               interval. Neural responses to rewards, pubertal development
               (self-report and testosterone levels), laboratory risk-taking
               (balloon analog risk task; BART), and self-reported risk-taking
               tendency (Behavior Inhibition System/Behavior Activation System
               questionnaire) were collected at both time points. The
               longitudinal analyses confirmed the quadratic age pattern for
               nucleus accumbens activity to rewards (peaking in adolescence),
               and the same quadratic pattern was found for laboratory
               risk-taking (BART). Nucleus accumbens activity change was further
               related to change in testosterone and self-reported
               reward-sensitivity (BAS Drive). Thus, this longitudinal analysis
               provides new insight in risk-taking and reward sensitivity in
               adolescence: (1) confirming an adolescent peak in nucleus
               accumbens activity, and (2) underlining a critical role for
               pubertal hormones and individual differences in risk-taking

              stimulus (Herrmann et al., 2010), as predicted by the
              normalization model of attention (Reynolds \& Heeger, 2009). For
              feature-based attention, unlike spatial attention, the model
              predicts only changes in response gain, regardless of whether the
              featural extent of the attention field is small or large. To test
              this prediction, we measured the contrast dependence of
              feature-based attention. Observers performed an
              orientation-discrimination task on a spatial array of grating
              patches. The spatial locations of the gratings were varied
              randomly so that observers could not attend to specific locations.
              Feature-based attention was manipulated with a 75\% valid and 25\%
              invalid pre-cue, and the featural extent of the attention field
              was manipulated by introducing uncertainty about the upcoming
              grating orientation. Performance accuracy was better for valid
              than for invalid pre-cues, consistent with a change in response
              gain, when the featural extent of the attention field was small
              (low uncertainty) or when it was large (high uncertainty) relative

                   planning and inverse reinforcement learning. These methods
                   infer a goal or reward function that best explains the
                   actions of the observed agent, typically a human
                   demonstrator. Another agent can use this inferred intent to
                   predict, imitate, or assist the human user. However, a
                   central assumption in inverse reinforcement learning is that
                   the demonstrator is close to optimal. While models of
                   suboptimal behavior exist, they typically assume that
                   suboptimal actions are the result of some type of random
                   noise or a known cognitive bias, like temporal inconsistency.
                   In this paper, we take an alternative approach, and model
                   suboptimal behavior as the result of internal model
                   misspecification: the reason that user actions might deviate
                   from near-optimal actions is that the user has an incorrect
                   set of beliefs about the rules -- the dynamics -- governing
                   how actions affect the environment. Our insight is that while
                   demonstrated actions may be suboptimal in the real world,
                   they may actually be near-optimal with respect to the user's
                   internal model of the dynamics. By estimating these internal
                   beliefs from observed behavior, we arrive at a new method for
                   inferring intent. We demonstrate in simulation and in a user
                   study with 12 participants that this approach enables us to
                   more accurately model human intent, and can be used in a
                   variety of applications, including offering assistance in a

               seen to pound objects with tools and to combine two different
               tool uses to get access to one food item. Tool making is the rule
               for abundant material (grass, twigs), but appears to be rarer for
               scarce, hard material (clubs, stones). Factors involved in the

               of temporal abstraction are key, longstanding challenges for AI.
               In this paper we consider how these challenges can be addressed
               within the mathematical framework of reinforcement learning and
               Markov decision processes (MDPs). We extend the usual notion of
               action in this framework to include options—closed-loop policies
               for taking action over a period of time. Examples of options
               include picking up an object, going to lunch, and traveling to a
               distant city, as well as primitive actions such as muscle
               twitches and joint torques. Overall, we show that options enable
               temporally abstract knowledge and action to be included in the
               reinforcement learning framework in a natural and general way. In
               particular, we show that options may be used interchangeably with
               primitive actions in planning methods such as dynamic programming
               and in learning methods such as Q-learning. Formally, a set of
               options defined over an MDP constitutes a semi-Markov decision
               process (SMDP), and the theory of SMDPs provides the foundation
               for the theory of options. However, the most interesting issues
               concern the interplay between the underlying MDP and the SMDP and
               are thus beyond SMDP theory. We present results for three such
               cases: (1) we show that the results of planning with options can
               be used during execution to interrupt options and thereby perform
               even better than planned, (2) we introduce new intra-option
               methods that are able to learn about an option from fragments of
               its execution, and (3) we propose a notion of subgoal that can be
               used to improve the options themselves. All of these results have
               precursors in the existing literature; the contribution of this
               paper is to establish them in a simpler and more general setting
               with fewer changes to the existing reinforcement learning
               framework. In particular, we show that these results can be
               obtained without committing to (or ruling out) any particular
               approach to state abstraction, hierarchy, function approximation,
               or the macro-utility problem.",

              still debated whether skilled decision-makers plan more steps
              ahead than novices6-8. Traditionally, the study of expertise in
              planning has used board games such as chess, but the complexity of
              these games poses a barrier to quantitative estimates of planning
              depth. Conversely, common planning tasks in cognitive science
              often have a lower complexity9,10 and impose a ceiling for the
              depth to which any player can plan. Here we investigate expertise
              in a complex board game that offers ample opportunity for skilled
              players to plan deeply. We use model fitting methods to show that
              human behaviour can be captured using a computational cognitive
              model based on heuristic search. To validate this model, we
              predict human choices, response times and eye movements. We also
              perform a Turing test and a reconstruction experiment. Using the
              model, we find robust evidence for increased planning depth with
              expertise in both laboratory and large-scale mobile data. Experts
              memorize and reconstruct board features more accurately. Using
              complex tasks combined with precise behavioural modelling might
              expand our understanding of human planning and help to bridge the

               diagnostic images in children, due to their small physical size
               and immaturity. Patient motion, cooperation and medical condition
               dictate the methods and equipment used. A customized approach

               appropriate combination of dedicated staff, imaging hardware, and
               software is key; these range from low-tech techniques, such as
               feed and swaddle, to specialized small bore MRI scanners, MRI

               surprising rigidity in how they think about problems (e.g.,
               ``functional fixedness'') that lead them astray. How can our
               capacity for behavioral flexibility be reconciled with our

               representing task details and the cost of switching between
               representations. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel
               paradigm that affords participants opportunities to choose
               different families of simplified representations to plan. In two
               preregistered, online studies (Ns = 377 and 294 adults), we found
               that participants' optimal behavior, suboptimal behavior, and
               reaction time were explained by a computational model that
               formalized people's avoidance of representational complexity and
               switching. These results demonstrate how the selection of
               simplified, rigid representations leads to the otherwise puzzling

              nine-dot problem, compound-remote associates task) as stimuli
              together with verbal reports from subjects during problem-solving
              to reveal their thought processes, possibly adding other
              task-related metrics such as completion rate and physiological
              measures like eye fixation and neural activity. This approach has
              led to the claims that insight and creative thought require
              impasse and mental restructuring. What is missing from this
              literature is a cognitive process model of insight, and one reason
              for the lack of such a model is the lack of a unified, scalable,

  abstract  = "Insight problem-solving has been a subject of fascination in the
               psychological sciences for approximately 100 years. As with most
               complex cognitive phenomena, perspectives on how to define,
               operationalize, and measure insight have evolved over time based
               on developments in theory, methodology, and technology. Research
               on insight can be broken into several phases, or waves,
               characterized by different theoretical and methodological
               paradigms. In the first wave, Gestalt psychologists introduced
               the concept of insight as a discontinuous form of learning and
               problemsolving that arises from changes in one’s global
               representation of a problem, in opposition to contemporary
               associationist views. In the second wave, psychologists examined
               insight in deliberate contrast with analytical problem-solving
               and found that insight involves nonreportable mental operations
               leading to a discrete, all-or-none availability of
               representational change. In the third wave, thanks to advances in
               behavioral methods and neuroimaging technology, cognitive
               neuroscientists began to examine how insight occurs in the brain
               with the goal of studying the neural states that co-occur with
               and precede the insight experience to better understand its
               cognitive mechanisms. The methodological advances made during
               these initial waves enabled the proliferation of research on
               insight over the last several decades and continue to inspire new
               discoveries and perspectives.In the first part of this chapter,
               we provide a brief retrospective on the first two waves of
               insight research with a particular focus on the theories and
               methods that informed subsequent neuroscience approaches …",

               spontaneous, diversified human tool use is an area devoted to the
               execution and observation of tool actions, located in the left
               anterior supramarginal gyrus (aSMG). The aSMG activation elicited
               by observing tool use is typical of human subjects, as macaques
               show no similar activation, even after an extensive training to
               use tools. The execution of tool actions, as well as their
               observation, requires the convergence upon aSMG of inputs from
               different parts of the dorsal and ventral visual streams.
               Non-semantic features of the target object may be provided by the
               posterior parietal cortex (PPC) for tool-object interaction,
               paralleling the well-known PPC input to anterior intraparietal
               (AIP) for hand-object interaction. Semantic information regarding
               tool identity, and knowledge of the typical manner of handling
               the tool, could be provided by inferior and middle regions of the
               temporal lobe. Somatosensory feedback and technical reasoning, as
               well as motor and intentional constraints also play roles during
               the planning of tool actions and consequently their signals
               likewise converge upon aSMG. We further propose that aSMG may
               have arisen though duplication of monkey AIP and invasion of the
               duplicate area by afferents from PPC providing distinct signals
               depending on the kinematics of the manipulative action. This
               duplication may have occurred when Homo Habilis or Homo Erectus
               emerged, generating the Oldowan or Acheulean Industrial complexes
               respectively. Hence tool use may have emerged during hominid
               evolution between bipedalism and language. We conclude that
               humans have two parietal systems involved in tool behavior: a
               biological circuit for grasping objects, including tools, and an
               artifactual system devoted specifically to tool use. Only the
               latter allows humans to understand the causal relationship
               between tool use and obtaining the goal, and is likely to be the
               basis of all technological developments.",

              discrete features is a hallmark of human cognition. But it is not
              clear exactly how (or whether) discrete features can effectively
              represent the complex probabilistic fabric of the environment.
              This article introduces information-theoretic tools for
              quantifying the fidelity and efficiency of a featural
              representation with respect to a probability model. In this
              framework, a feature or combination of features is ``faithful'' to
              the extent that knowing the value of the features reduces
              uncertainty about the true state of the world. In a single
              dimension, a discrete feature is faithful if the values of the
              feature correspond isomorphically to distinct classes in the
              probability model. But in multiple dimensions, the situation is
              more complicated: The fidelity of each feature depends on the
              direction in multidimensional feature space in which the feature
              is projected from the underlying distribution. More interestingly,
              distributions may be more effectively represented by combinations
              of projected features-that is, compositionality. For any given
              distribution, a variety of compositional forms (features and
              combination rules) are possible, which can be quite different from
              one another, entailing different degrees of fidelity, different
              numbers of features, and even different induced regularities. This
              article proposes three specific criteria for a compositional
              representation: fidelity, simplicity, and robustness. The

              theories propose that stimuli with an intermediate degree of
              uncertainty stimulate curiosity. In this article, we present a
              rational analysis of curiosity by considering the computational
              problem underlying curiosity, which allows us to model these
              distinct accounts of curiosity in a common framework. Our approach
              posits that a rational agent should explore stimuli that maximally
              increase the usefulness of its knowledge and that curiosity is the
              mechanism by which humans approximate this rational behavior.
              Critically, our analysis show that the causal structure of the
              environment can determine whether curiosity is driven by either
              highly uncertain or moderately uncertain stimuli. This suggests

                   by parsing demonstrations into sequences of named high-level

              being slow, to make use of one object (the tack box) as a support,
              rather than as a container, in their solutions. This failure to
              produce alternate functions is measured against improved
              performance when the tack box is presented empty rather than full
              of tacks (i.e., not preutilized as a container). Using an
              analogous task, we show that functional fixedness can be

              significantly slower to use a box as a support when its

              However, younger children (5-year-olds) are immune to this effect,

              not be zoologically unique, but it is certainly extraordinary. Yet
              little is known about the conceptual machinery that makes humans
              so competent at making and using tools. Do adults and children
              have concepts specialized for understanding human-made artifacts?
              If so, are these concepts deployed in attempts to solve novel
              problems? Here we present new data, derived from problem-solving
              experiments, which support the following. (i) The structure of the
              child's concept of artifact function changes profoundly between
              ages 5 and 7. At age 5, the child's conceptual machinery defines
              the function of an artifact as any goal a user might have; by age
              7, its function is defined by the artifact's typical or intended
              use. (ii) This conceptual shift has a striking effect on
              problem-solving performance, i.e. the child's concept of artifact
              function appears to be deployed in problem solving. (iii) This
              effect on problem solving is not caused by differences in the
              amount of knowledge that children have about the typical use of a
              particular tool; it is mediated by the structure of the child's
              artifact concept (which organizes and deploys the child's
              knowledge). In two studies, children between 5 and 7 years of age
              were matched for their knowledge of what a particular artifact
              ``is for'', and then given a problem that can only be solved if
              that tool is used for an atypical purpose. All children performed
              well in a baseline condition. But when they were primed by a
              demonstration of the artifact's typical function, 5-year-old
              children solved the problem much faster than 6-7-year-old
              children. Because all children knew what the tools were for,
              differences in knowledge alone cannot explain the results. We
              argue that the older children were slower to solve the problem
              when the typical function was primed because (i) their artifact
              concept plays a role in problem solving, and (ii) intended purpose
              is central to their concept of artifact function, but not to that
              of the younger children.",

              time pressure (limited vs. unlimited). With limited time, people
              have less opportunity to perform costly computations, thus
              shifting the cost-benefit balance of different exploration
              strategies. Through behavioral, reinforcement learning (RL),
              reaction time (RT), and evidence accumulation analyses, we show
              that time pressure changes how people explore and respond to
              uncertainty. Specifically, participants reduced their
              uncertainty-directed exploration under time pressure, were less
              value-directed, and repeated choices more often. Since our
              analyses relate uncertainty to slower responses and dampened
              evidence accumulation (i.e., drift rates), this demonstrates a
              resource-rational shift towards simpler, lower-cost strategies
              under time pressure. These results shed light on how people adapt
              their exploration and decision-making strategies to externally
              imposed cognitive constraints.",

              his doctoral thesis published in 1942. The effect occurs when a
              repeated solution to old problems is applied to a new problem even
              though a more appropriate response is available. In Luchins’
              so-called water jar task, participants had to measure a specific
              amount of water using three jars of different capacities. Luchins
              found that subjects kept using methods they had applied in
              previous trials, even if a more efficient solution for the current
              trial was available: an Einstellung effect. Moreover, Luchins
              studied the different conditions that could possibly mediate this
              effect, including telling participants to pay more attention,
              changing the number of tasks, alternating between different types
              of tasks, as well as putting participants under time pressure. In
              the current work, we reconstruct and reanalyze the data of the

              furthermore show that a model of resource-rational decision-making

              maximize rewards under time constraints. Taken together, our

              learning the general value of different behaviors, and
              prioritizing thinking about high-value options in new situations.
              Is this good-action bias always the best strategy, or can thinking
              about low-value options sometimes become more beneficial? Can
              people adapt their thinking accordingly based on the situation?
              And how do we know what to think about in novel events? Here, we
              developed a block-puzzle paradigm that enabled us to measure

              with a novel puzzle box, the Multiple-Methods Box (MMB), which
              offered multiple innovation opportunities to extract a reward
              using different tools, access points and exits. 209 children were
              assigned to conditions in which eight social demonstrations of a
              reward retrieval method were provided; each condition differed
              incrementally in terms of the method's efficacy (0\%, 25\%, 75\%,
              and 100\% success at extracting the reward). An additional 47
              children were assigned to a no-demonstration control condition.
              Innovative reward extractions from the MMB increased with
              decreasing efficacy of the demonstrated method. However, imitation
              remained a widely used strategy irrespective of the efficacy of

              one imitative attempt, and imitated on an average of 4.9 out of 8

                   Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) is a promising
                   self-supervised RL paradigm, wherein the free parameters of
                   an underspecified environment are automatically adapted
                   during training to the agent's capabilities, leading to the
                   emergence of diverse training environments. Here, we cast
                   Prioritized Level Replay (PLR), an empirically successful but
                   theoretically unmotivated method that selectively samples
                   randomly-generated training levels, as UED. We argue that by
                   curating completely random levels, PLR, too, can generate
                   novel and complex levels for effective training. This insight
                   reveals a natural class of UED methods we call Dual
                   Curriculum Design (DCD). Crucially, DCD includes both PLR and
                   a popular UED algorithm, PAIRED, as special cases and
                   inherits similar theoretical guarantees. This connection
                   allows us to develop novel theory for PLR, providing a
                   version with a robustness guarantee at Nash equilibria.
                   Furthermore, our theory suggests a highly counterintuitive
                   improvement to PLR: by stopping the agent from updating its
                   policy on uncurated levels (training on less data), we can
                   improve the convergence to Nash equilibria. Indeed, our
                   experiments confirm that our new method, PLR$^{\perp}$,
                   obtains better results on a suite of out-of-distribution,
                   zero-shot transfer tasks, in addition to demonstrating that
                   PLR$^{\perp}$ improves the performance of PAIRED, from which

                   Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) often fall
                   short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive
                   success on research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a
                   systematic study of the inductive reasoning capabilities of
                   LMs through iterative hypothesis refinement, a technique that
                   more closely mirrors the human inductive process than
                   standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis
                   refinement employs a three-step process: proposing,
                   selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual
                   rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that
                   LMs are phenomenal hypothesis proposers (i.e., generating
                   candidate rules), and when coupled with a (task-specific)
                   symbolic interpreter that is able to systematically filter
                   the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves
                   strong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that

              To explore this, we study human judgments in a challenging task
              that involves actively gathering evidence about a symbolic rule
              governing the behavior of a simulated environment. Participants
              learn by performing mini-experiments before making generalizations
              and explicit guesses about a hidden rule. They then collect
              additional evidence themselves (Experiment 1) or observe evidence
              gathered by someone else (Experiment 2) before revising their own
              generalizations and guesses. In each case, we focus on the
              relationship between participants' initial and revised guesses

               not pre-trained on natural language data before being trained to

               pre-training has been found to induce hierarchical linguistic
               generalizations in language models; in other words, the syntactic
               capabilities of seq2seq models may have been greatly understated.
               We address this gap using the pre-trained seq2seq models T5 and

              `Embodied cognition' suggests that our motor experiences shape our

              tasks that directly relate to or manipulate the body. Here we

              two-handed children and adults -- perform on this task, and find
              that while there is no difference in overall performance,
              limb-different participants solved problems using fewer actions,
              and spent a longer time thinking before acting. This suggests that

               successfully tackling. Categorization is also a fundamental
               cognitive ability. A well-known perceptual consequence of
               categorization in humans and other animals, categorical
               perception, is notably characterized by a within-category
               compression and a between-category separation: two items, close
               in input space, are perceived closer if they belong to the same
               category than if they belong to different categories. Elaborating
               on experimental and theoretical results in cognitive science,
               here we study categorical effects in artificial neural networks.
               We combine a theoretical analysis that makes use of mutual and
               Fisher information quantities and a series of numerical
               simulations on networks of increasing complexity. These formal
               and numerical analyses provide insights into the geometry of the
               neural representation in deep layers, with expansion of space
               near category boundaries and contraction far from category
               boundaries. We investigate categorical representation by using
               two complementary approaches: one mimics experiments in
               psychophysics and cognitive neuroscience by means of morphed
               continua between stimuli of different categories, while the other
               introduces a categoricality index that, for each layer in the
               network, quantifies the separability of the categories at the
               neural population level. We show on both shallow and deep neural
               networks that category learning automatically induces categorical
               perception. We further show that the deeper a layer, the stronger
               the categorical effects. As an outcome of our study, we propose a
               coherent view of the efficacy of different heuristic practices of
               the dropout regularization technique. More generally, our view,
               which finds echoes in the neuroscience literature, insists on the
               differential impact of noise in any given layer depending on the
               geometry of the neural representation that is being learned, that
               is, on how this geometry reflects the structure of the

              to find a solution until * aha! * the solution suddenly appears.
              Two contemporary theories suggest that insight problems are
              difficult either because problem solvers begin with an incorrect
              representation of the problem, or that problem solvers apply
              inappropriate heuristics to the problem. The relative
              contributions of representational change and inappropriate
              heuristics on the process of insight problem solving was studied
              with a task that required the problem solver to move two
              matchsticks in order to transform an incorrect arithmetic
              statement into a correct one. Problem solvers (N = 120) worked on
              two different types of two-move matchstick arithmetic problems
              that both varied with respect to the effectiveness of heuristics
              and to the degree of a necessary representational change of the
              problem representation. A strong influence of representational
              change on solution rates was found whereas the influence of
              heuristics had minimal effects on solution rates. That is, the

                   reasoning in stationary scenes, creating a gap in evaluating
                   agents' abilities to interact with dynamic events. While
                   contemporary methods allow agents to modify initial scene
                   configurations and observe consequences, they lack the
                   capability to interact with events in real time. To address
                   this, we introduce I-PHYRE, a framework that challenges
                   agents to simultaneously exhibit intuitive physical
                   reasoning, multi-step planning, and in-situ intervention.
                   Here, intuitive physical reasoning refers to a quick,
                   approximate understanding of physics to address complex
                   problems; multi-step denotes the need for extensive sequence
                   planning in I-PHYRE, considering each intervention can
                   significantly alter subsequent choices; and in-situ implies
                   the necessity for timely object manipulation within a scene,

              tool (a spoon) in infants during the second year of life. Infants
              between 14 and 18 months of age were given a task requiring an
              unconventional grasp of a spoon (at its bowl) and inserting its
              handle into a box’s hole. Success in this task requires infants to
              inhibit their conventional action plan (grasping the spoon’s
              handle) and instead perform the task as demonstrated by the
              experimenter at the beginning of the trial (grasping the spoon’s
              bowl). Prior research had revealed that infants in this age range
              had a low success rate in this task. To investigate the
              possibility that infants’ difficulty in the task was related to
              their inability to inhibit the well-practiced conventional
              grasping behavior (e.g., grasping the spoon’s handle), the tools
              (the spoon and a novel tool on different trials) were presented in
              a holder that restricted grasping to the bowl of the tools, and on
              the table that did not restrict the grasping of the tools. The
              study measures included overall success, time taken to succeed, as
              well as the grasping strategies used by infants during the task.
              Parents responded to questions about their infant’s

              associations between these measures and infants’ performance on

              on the table) were reliable predictors of infants’ success in the

              home, as well as better inhibitory control showed more appropriate

              occurs in which aspects of sensory experience determine the
              pattern of connections that remains. Experience-dependent
              information storage refers to incorporation of environmental
              information that is idiosyncratic, or unique to the individual,
              such as learning about one's specific physical environment or
              vocabulary. The neural basis of experience-dependent processes
              appears to involve active formation of new synaptic connections in
              response to the events providing the information to be stored.
              Although these processes probably do not occur entirely
              independently of one another in development, the categories offer
              a new view more in accord with neural mechanisms than were terms
              like ``critical'' or ``sensitive period.''",

              right eye for various periods of time at different ages.
              Recordings were subsequently made from the striate cortex, and
              responses from the two eyes compared. As previously reported,
              monocular eye closure during the first few months of life causes a
              sharp decline in the number of cells that can be influenced by the
              previously closed eye.2. Susceptibility to the effects of eye
              closure begins suddenly near the start of the fourth week, remains
              high until some time between the sixth and eighth weeks, and then
              declines, disappearing finally around the end of the third month.
              Monocular closure for over a year in an adult cat produces no
              detectable effects.3. During the period of high susceptibility in
              the fourth and fifth weeks eye closure for as little as 3-4 days
              leads to a sharp decline in the number of cells that can be driven
              from both eyes, as well as an over-all decline in the relative
              influence of the previously closed eye. A 6-day closure is enough
              to give a reduction in the number of cells that can be driven by
              the closed eye to a fraction of the normal. The physiological
              picture is similar to that following a 3-month monocular
              deprivation from birth, in which the proportion of cells the eye
              can influence drops from 85 to about 7\%.4. Cells of the lateral
              geniculate receiving input from a deprived eye are noticeably
              smaller and paler to Nissl stain following 3 or 6 days'
              deprivation during the fourth week.5. Following 3 months of
              monocular deprivation, opening the eye for up to 5 yr produces
              only a very limited recovery in the cortical physiology, and no
              obvious recovery of the geniculate atrophy, even though
              behaviourally there is some return of vision in the deprived eye.
              Closing the normal eye, though necessary for behavioural recovery,
              has no detectable effect on the cortical physiology. The amount of
              possible recovery in the striate cortex is probably no greater if
              the period of eye closure is limited to weeks, but after a 5-week
              closure there is a definite enhancement of the recovery, even
              though it is far from complete.",

              categories are abstract and conceptual, whose instances share a

              variable in their affective, physical, and perceptual features.
              Next, we discuss the possibility that emotional development is the
              process of developing emotion concepts, and that emotion words may
              be a critical part of this process. We hypothesize that infants
              and children learn emotion categories the way they learn other
              abstract conceptual categories-by observing others use the same
              emotion word to label highly variable events. Finally, we
              hypothesize that emotional development can be understood as a
              concept construction problem: a child becomes capable of
              experiencing and perceiving emotion only when her brain develops
              the capacity to assemble ad hoc, situated emotion concepts for the
              purposes of guiding behavior and giving meaning to sensory inputs.

                   shackled to a narrow domain-specific language that they can

               networks have advanced considerably in the years since, yet the
               systematicity challenge persists. Here we successfully address

              people more often falsely report having seen a recombined word
              pair (e.g., flower: garden) if it instantiates the same semantic
              relation (e.g., is a part of) as a studied word pair (e.g., house:
              town). This phenomenon, termed relational luring, has been
              interpreted as evidence that explicit relation
              representations-known to play a central role in analogical
              reasoning-also impact episodic memory. We replicate and extend
              previous studies, showing that relation-based false alarms in
              recognition memory occur after participants encode word pairs
              either by making relatedness judgments about individual words
              presented sequentially, or by evaluating analogies between pairs
              of word pairs. To test alternative explanations of relational
              luring, we implemented an established model of recognition memory,
              the Generalized Context Model (GCM). Within this basic framework,
              we compared representations of word pairs based on similarities
              derived either from explicit relations or from lexical semantics
              (i.e., individual word meanings). In two experiments on
              recognition memory, best-fitting values of GCM parameters enabled
              both similarity models (even the model based solely on lexical
              semantics) to predict relational luring with comparable accuracy.
              However, the model based on explicit relations proved more robust
              to parameter variations than that based on lexical similarity. We
              found this same pattern of modeling results when applying GCM to
              an independent set of data reported by Popov, Hristova, and Anders

                   not only where the characters currently are, but also their
                   motions, their motivations, their emotions, and what they
                   might do next. More generally, humans routinely infer complex
                   sequences of past and future events from a *static snapshot*
                   of a *dynamic scene*, even in situations they have never seen
                   before. In this paper, we model how humans make such rapid
                   and flexible inferences. Building on a long line of work in
                   cognitive science, we offer a Monte Carlo algorithm whose
                   inferences correlate well with human intuitions in a wide
                   variety of domains, while only using a small,
                   cognitively-plausible number of samples. Our key technical
                   insight is a surprising connection between our inference
                   problem and Monte Carlo path tracing, which allows us to
                   apply decades of ideas from the computer graphics community

              cognitive structure in problem solving research. We propose that
              the explanation of insight is beyond the scope of conventional
              approaches to cognitive science in terms of symbolic

              open, nonlinear dynamical system. By this reasoning, insight would
              be the self-organization of novel structure. Self-organization is
              a well-studied phenomenon of dynamical systems theory, associated
              with specific trends in entropy and power-law behavior. We present
              work using nonlinear dynamics to capture these trends in entropy
              and power-law behavior and thus to predict the self-organization

              this time, there is substantial pruning of excitatory synapses in
              cortex and specifically in prefrontal cortex. We have trained a
              series of recurrent neural networks to solve a working memory task
              and a reinforcement learning (RL) task. Performance on both of
              these tasks is known to improve during adolescence. After
              training, we pruned the networks by removing weak synapses.
              Pruning was done incrementally, and the networks were retrained
              during pruning. We found that pruned networks trained on the

              Using comparative relations as a model domain, we explore the
              possibility that bottom-up learning mechanisms applied to objects
              coded as feature vectors can yield representations of relations
              sufficient to solve analogy problems. We introduce Bayesian
              analogy with relational transformations (BART) and apply the model
              to the task of learning first-order comparative relations (e.g.,
              larger, smaller, fiercer, meeker) from a set of animal pairs.
              Inputs are coded by vectors of continuous-valued features, based
              either on human magnitude ratings, normed feature ratings (De
              Deyne et al., 2008), or outputs of the topics model (Griffiths,
              Steyvers, \& Tenenbaum, 2007). Bootstrapping from empirical
              priors, the model is able to induce first-order relations
              represented as probabilistic weight distributions, even when given
              positive examples only. These learned representations allow
              classification of novel instantiations of the relations and yield
              a symbolic distance effect of the sort obtained with both humans
              and other primates. BART then transforms its learned weight
              distributions by importance-guided mapping, thereby placing
              distinct dimensions into correspondence. These transformed
              representations allow BART to reliably solve 4-term analogies
              (e.g., larger:smaller::fiercer:meeker), a type of reasoning that
              is arguably specific to humans. Our results provide a
              proof-of-concept that structured analogies can be solved with
              representations induced from unstructured feature vectors by
              mechanisms that operate in a largely bottom-up fashion. We discuss

              around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this
              represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein
              sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to
              years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein
              structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address
              this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics.
              Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will
              adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure
              prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an
              important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite
              recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic
              accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available.
              Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly
              predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in

              bed bugs. The discovery of unobserved objects almost always
              involves a backward inference from some observed effects (e.g.,
              welts) to unobserved causes (e.g., bed bugs). The inverse
              reasoning account, which is typically formalized as Bayesian
              inference, posits that the strength of a backward inference is
              closely connected to the strength of the corresponding forward
              inference from the unobserved causes to the observed effects. We
              evaluated the inverse reasoning account of object discovery in
              three experiments where participants were asked to discover the
              unobserved ``attractors'' and ``repellers'' that controlled a
              ``particle'' moving within an arena. Experiments 1 and 2 showed
              that participants often failed to provide the best explanations
              for various particle motions, even when the best explanations were
              simple and when participants enthusiastically endorsed these

              Bayesian ideal and other times systematically biased? In
              particular, why do humans make near-rational inferences in some
              natural domains where the candidate hypotheses are explicitly
              available, whereas tasks in similar domains requiring the
              self-generation of hypotheses produce systematic deviations from
              rational inference. We propose that these deviations arise from
              algorithmic processes approximating Bayes' rule. Specifically in
              our account, hypotheses are generated stochastically from a
              sampling process, such that the sampled hypotheses form a Monte
              Carlo approximation of the posterior. While this approximation
              will converge to the true posterior in the limit of infinite
              samples, we take a small number of samples as we expect that the
              number of samples humans take is limited. We show that this model
              recreates several well-documented experimental findings such as
              anchoring and adjustment, subadditivity, superadditivity, the
              crowd within as well as the self-generation effect, the weak
              evidence, and the dud alternative effects. We confirm the model's
              prediction that superadditivity and subadditivity can be induced
              within the same paradigm by manipulating the unpacking and
              typicality of hypotheses. We also partially confirm our model's
              prediction about the effect of time pressure and cognitive load on
              these effects.",

              prefrontal neurons relates to this profound cognitive development.
              To examine this, we tracked neuronal responses of the prefrontal
              cortex in monkeys as they transitioned from puberty into adulthood
              and compared activity at different developmental stages.
              Performance of the antisaccade task greatly improved in this

              reduction of stimulus-driven activity, increased saccadic
              activity, or enhanced representation of the opposing goal
              location, only the latter was evident in adulthood. Greatly

              A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in

              typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons.
              Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary

              encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information.

               new understanding occurred to them suddenly, in an unexpected
               flash. Do people generally experience such “Eureka” moments when
               learning science concepts? And if so, do these episodes truly
               vehicle sudden insights, or is this impression illusory? To
               address these questions, we developed a paradigm where
               participants were taught the mathematical concept of geodesic,
               which generalizes the common notion of straight line to straight
               trajectories drawn on curved surfaces. After studying lessons
               introducing this concept on the sphere, participants (N = 56)
               were tested on their understanding of geodesics on the sphere and
               on other surfaces. Our findings indicate that Eureka experiences
               are common when learning mathematics, with reports by 34 (61\%)
               participants. Moreover, Eureka experiences proved an accurate
               description of participants’ learning, in two respects. First,
               Eureka experiences were associated with learning and
               generalization: the participants who reported experiencing
               Eurekas performed better at identifying counterintuitive
               geodesics on new surfaces. Second, and in line with the
               firstperson experience of a sudden insight, our findings suggest
               that the learning mechanisms responsible for Eureka experiences
               are inaccessible to reflective introspection. Specifically,
               reports of Eureka experiences and of participants’ confidence in
               their own understanding were associated with different profiles
               of performance, indicating that the mechanisms bringing about
               Eureka experiences and those informing reflective confidence were
               at least partially dissociated. Learning mathematical concepts
               thus appears to involve mechanisms that operate unconsciously,
               except when a key computational step is reached and a sudden
               insight breaks into consciousness.",

  abstract      = "Inductive reasoning is a core problem-solving capacity:
                   humans can identify underlying principles from a few
                   examples, which can then be robustly generalized to novel
                   scenarios. Recent work has evaluated large language models
                   (LLMs) on inductive reasoning tasks by directly prompting
                   them yielding ``in context learning.'' This can work well for
                   straightforward inductive tasks, but performs very poorly on
                   more complex tasks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning
                   Corpus (ARC). In this work, we propose to improve the
                   inductive reasoning ability of LLMs by generating explicit
                   hypotheses at multiple levels of abstraction: we prompt the
                   LLM to propose multiple abstract hypotheses about the
                   problem, in natural language, then implement the natural
                   language hypotheses as concrete Python programs. These
                   programs can be directly verified by running on the observed
                   examples and generalized to novel inputs. Because of the
                   prohibitive cost of generation with state-of-the-art LLMs, we
                   consider a middle step to filter the set of hypotheses that
                   will be implemented into programs: we either ask the LLM to
                   summarize into a smaller set of hypotheses, or ask human
                   annotators to select a subset of the hypotheses. We verify
                   our pipeline's effectiveness on the ARC visual inductive
                   reasoning benchmark, its variant 1D-ARC, and string
                   transformation dataset SyGuS. On a random 40-problem subset
                   of ARC, our automated pipeline using LLM summaries achieves
                   27.5\% accuracy, significantly outperforming the direct
                   prompting baseline (accuracy of 12.5\%). With the minimal
                   human input of selecting from LLM-generated candidates, the
                   performance is boosted to 37.5\%. (And we argue this is a
                   lower bound on the performance of our approach without
                   filtering.) Our ablation studies show that abstract
                   hypothesis generation and concrete program representations
                   are both beneficial for LLMs to perform inductive reasoning
                   tasks.",

              Experiment 1 replicated the finding by Hall (1995) (unpublished

              artifact over a current function in their kind judgments.
              Experiments 2 and 3 revealed that whereas the kind judgments of
              6-year-olds, like those of adults, patterned with the original
              function, those of 4-year-olds did not. Four-year-olds were

                   expertise at the world's oldest board games and many classic
                   video games, but they require vast quantities of experience
                   to learn successfully -- none of today's algorithms account
                   for the human ability to learn so many different tasks, so
                   quickly. Here we propose a new approach to this challenge
                   based on a particularly strong form of model-based RL which
                   we call Theory-Based Reinforcement Learning, because it uses
                   human-like intuitive theories -- rich, abstract, causal
                   models of physical objects, intentional agents, and their
                   interactions -- to explore and model an environment, and plan
                   effectively to achieve task goals. We instantiate the
                   approach in a video game playing agent called EMPA (the
                   Exploring, Modeling, and Planning Agent), which performs
                   Bayesian inference to learn probabilistic generative models
                   expressed as programs for a game-engine simulator, and runs
                   internal simulations over these models to support efficient
                   object-based, relational exploration and heuristic planning.
                   EMPA closely matches human learning efficiency on a suite of
                   90 challenging Atari-style video games, learning new games in
                   just minutes of game play and generalizing robustly to new
                   game situations and new levels. The model also captures

  author   = "Patel, Roma and Pavlick, Ellie",
  abstract = "A fundamental criticism of text-only language models (LMs) is
              their lack of grounding---that is, the ability to tie a word for
              which they have learned a representation, to its actual use in the
              world. However, despite this limitation, large pre-trained LMs
              have been shown to have a remarkable grasp of the conceptual
              structure of language, as demonstrated by their ability to answer
              questions, generate fluent text, or make inferences about
              entities, objects, and properties that they have never physically
              observed. In this work we investigate the extent to which the rich
              conceptual structure that LMs learn indeed reflects the conceptual
              structure of the non-linguistic world---which is something that
              LMs have never observed. We do this by testing whether the LMs can
              learn to map an entire conceptual domain (e.g., direction or
              colour) onto a grounded world representation given only a small
              number of examples. For example, we show a model what the word
              ``left`` means using a textual depiction of a grid world, and
              assess how well it can generalise to related concepts, for
              example, the word ``right'', in a similar grid world. We
              investigate a range of generative language models of varying sizes
              (including GPT-2 and GPT-3), and see that although the smaller
              models struggle to perform this mapping, the largest model can not
              only learn to ground the concepts that it is explicitly taught,
              but appears to generalise to several instances of unseen concepts
              as well. Our results suggest an alternative means of building
              grounded language models: rather than learning grounded
              representations ``from scratch'', it is possible that large
              text-only models learn a sufficiently rich conceptual structure
              that could allow them to be grounded in a data-efficient way.",

              and that people report non-commitment rather than uncertainty or
              forgetfulness (Study 3). Such non-commitment is present even for
              people with generally vivid imaginations, and those who report
              imagining the specified scene very vividly (Studies 4a, 4b).
              People readily confabulate properties of their mental images when
              non-commitment is not offered as an explicit option (Study 5).

                   affect pre-training loss or transfer to downstream tasks at
                   all. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss

                   TextPruner, an open-source model pruning toolkit designed for
                   pre-trained language models, targeting fast and easy model

                   pruning methods, including vocabulary pruning and transformer
                   pruning, and can be applied to various models and tasks. We
                   also propose a self-supervised pruning method that can be
                   applied without the labeled data. Our experiments with
                   several NLP tasks demonstrate the ability of TextPruner to

                   of applications in natural language processing. However, they
                   are inefficient and difficult to deploy. In recent years,
                   many compression algorithms have been proposed to increase
                   the implementation efficiency of large Transformer-based
                   models on target hardware. In this work we present a new
                   method for training sparse pre-trained Transformer language
                   models by integrating weight pruning and model distillation.
                   These sparse pre-trained models can be used to transfer
                   learning for a wide range of tasks while maintaining their
                   sparsity pattern. We demonstrate our method with three known
                   architectures to create sparse pre-trained BERT-Base,
                   BERT-Large and DistilBERT. We show how the compressed sparse
                   pre-trained models we trained transfer their knowledge to
                   five different downstream natural language tasks with minimal
                   accuracy loss. Moreover, we show how to further compress the
                   sparse models' weights to 8bit precision using
                   quantization-aware training. For example, with our sparse
                   pre-trained BERT-Large fine-tuned on SQuADv1.1 and quantized
                   to 8bit we achieve a compression ratio of $40$X for the
                   encoder with less than $1\%$ accuracy loss. To the best of
                   our knowledge, our results show the best
                   compression-to-accuracy ratio for BERT-Base, BERT-Large, and
                   DistilBERT.",

                   impressive capabilities across tasks in language
                   understanding and interactive decision making, their
                   abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and
                   acting (e.g. action plan generation) have primarily been
                   studied as separate topics. In this paper, we explore the use
                   of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific
                   actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater
                   synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model
                   induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle
                   exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external
                   sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather
                   additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct,
                   to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and
                   demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art

                   trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting
                   components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and

                   hallucination and error propagation prevalent in

                   trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines
                   without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making

  abstract      = "A long-held objective in AI is to build systems that
                   understand concepts in a humanlike way. Setting aside the
                   difficulty of building such a system, even trying to evaluate
                   one is a challenge, due to present-day AI's relative opacity
                   and its proclivity for finding shortcut solutions. This is
                   exacerbated by humans' tendency to anthropomorphize, assuming
                   that a system that can recognize one instance of a concept
                   must also understand other instances, as a human would. In
                   this paper, we argue that understanding a concept requires
                   the ability to use it in varied contexts. Accordingly, we
                   propose systematic evaluations centered around concepts, by
                   probing a system's ability to use a given concept in many
                   different instantiations. We present case studies of such an

  abstract      = "Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with
                   surging interest in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in
                   this domain heavily relies on faithful representation of the
                   sparsity of subnetworks, which has been traditionally
                   computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct
                   sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize
                   unpruned parameters that detached from input or output layers
                   of underlying subnetworks, potentially underestimating actual
                   effective sparsity: the fraction of inactivated connections.
                   While this effect might be negligible for moderately pruned
                   networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it
                   plays an increasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly
                   distorting comparison between different pruning algorithms.
                   For example, we show that effective compression of a randomly
                   pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than
                   its direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed
                   when using SynFlow for pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this
                   work, we adopt the lens of effective sparsity to reevaluate
                   several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark
                   architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and
                   discover that their absolute and relative performance changes
                   dramatically in this new and more appropriate framework. To
                   aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we develop a
                   low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further,
                   equipped with effective sparsity as a reference frame, we
                   partially reconfirm that random pruning with appropriate
                   sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or better
                   than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at
                   initialization [Su et al., 2020]. In response to this
                   observation, using a simple analogy of pressure distribution
                   in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise
                   sparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the

                   tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of
                   text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While
                   typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still
                   requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or
                   tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can
                   generally perform a new language task from only a few
                   examples or from simple instructions - something which
                   current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we
                   show that scaling up language models greatly improves
                   task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching
                   competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
                   approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive
                   language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any
                   previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance
                   in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied
                   without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and
                   few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction
                   with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP
                   datasets, including translation, question-answering, and
                   cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly
                   reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words,
                   using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit
                   arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets
                   where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as
                   some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related
                   to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3

                   available to them? This process must involve some inductive
                   biases - factors that affect how a learner generalizes - but
                   it is unclear which inductive biases can explain observed
                   patterns in language acquisition. To facilitate computational
                   modeling aimed at addressing this question, we introduce a
                   framework for giving particular linguistic inductive biases
                   to a neural network model; such a model can then be used to
                   empirically explore the effects of those inductive biases.
                   This framework disentangles universal inductive biases, which
                   are encoded in the initial values of a neural network's
                   parameters, from non-universal factors, which the neural
                   network must learn from data in a given language. The initial
                   state that encodes the inductive biases is found with
                   meta-learning, a technique through which a model discovers
                   how to acquire new languages more easily via exposure to many
                   possible languages. By controlling the properties of the
                   languages that are used during meta-learning, we can control
                   the inductive biases that meta-learning imparts. We
                   demonstrate this framework with a case study based on
                   syllable structure. First, we specify the inductive biases
                   that we intend to give our model, and then we translate those
                   inductive biases into a space of languages from which a model
                   can meta-learn. Finally, using existing analysis techniques,
                   we verify that our approach has imparted the linguistic
                   inductive biases that it was intended to impart.",

                   learning of algorithmic tasks that mix perception and
                   procedural reasoning. Reusing high-level concepts across
                   domains and learning complex procedures are key challenges in
                   lifelong learning. We show that a program synthesis approach
                   that combines gradient descent with combinatorial search over
                   programs can be a more effective response to these challenges
                   than purely neural methods. Our framework, called HOUDINI,
                   represents neural networks as strongly typed, differentiable
                   functional programs that use symbolic higher-order
                   combinators to compose a library of neural functions. Our
                   learning algorithm consists of: (1) a symbolic program
                   synthesizer that performs a type-directed search over
                   parameterized programs, and decides on the library functions
                   to reuse, and the architectures to combine them, while
                   learning a sequence of tasks; and (2) a neural module that
                   trains these programs using stochastic gradient descent. We
                   evaluate HOUDINI on three benchmarks that combine perception
                   with the algorithmic tasks of counting, summing, and
                   shortest-path computation. Our experiments show that HOUDINI

                   traditional transfer learning and progressive neural
                   networks, and that the typed representation of networks

                   Encountering a novel phenomenon, children make hypotheses

                   their theory via experimentation, and correct the proposition
                   if inconsistency arises. Rounds of such processes continue
                   until the underlying mechanism is found. Towards building
                   machines that can learn and think like people, one natural
                   question for us to ask is: whether the intelligence we

                   the EST environment for evaluating the scientific thinking

                   time step, the agent proposes new experiments to validate its

              framework for the quantitative analysis of the information
              produced by physical interactions. We then describe two
              experiments that present participants with moving objects in
              ``microworlds'' that operate according to continuous
              spatiotemporal dynamics similar to everyday physics (i.e., forces
              of gravity, friction, etc.). Participants were asked to interact
              with objects in the microworlds in order to identify their masses,
              or the forces of attraction/repulsion that governed their

              interventions that can discriminate between a learner's hypotheses

              individual hypotheses. Experiment 1 shows that individual behavior

              investigated children's exploratory play after an adult
              pedagogically demonstrated a function of a toy, after an
              interrupted pedagogical demonstration, after a naïve adult
              demonstrated the function, and at baseline. Preschoolers in the
              pedagogical condition focused almost exclusively on the target
              function; by contrast, children in the other conditions explored
              broadly. In Experiment 2, we show that children restrict their
              exploration both after direct instruction to themselves and after
              overhearing direct instruction given to another child; they do not
              show this constraint after observing direct instruction given to
              an adult or after observing a non-pedagogical intentional action.
              We discuss these findings as the result of rational inductive
              biases. In pedagogical contexts, a teacher's failure to provide
              evidence for additional functions provides evidence for their
              absence; such contexts generalize from child to child (because
              children are likely to have comparable states of knowledge) but
              not from adult to child. Thus, pedagogy promotes efficient
              learning but at a cost: children are less likely to perform
              potentially irrelevant actions but also less likely to discover
              novel information.",

              across this transition, but the lack of longitudinal studies makes
              this transition difficult to understand. The current study
              explored the longitudinal and bidirectional associations between
              accuracy and RT on the DCCS (mixed block) at 5, 6, and 7 years of

              mediators between RT at Time X and accuracy at Time X + 1, and
              explored the role of inhibitory control. The sample consisted of
              425 children from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child

                   representations from vision models can be transferred as
                   continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only a single
                   linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves
                   competitive performance on captioning and visual question
                   answering tasks compared to models that tune both the image
                   encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA model). We
                   compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of
                   linguistic supervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no
                   linguistic information), NF-ResNET (lexical category
                   information), and CLIP (full natural language descriptions).
                   We find that all three encoders perform equally well at
                   transferring visual property information to the language
                   model (e.g., whether an animal is large or small), but that
                   image encoders pretrained with linguistic supervision more
                   saliently encode category information (e.g., distinguishing
                   hippo vs.\\ elephant) and thus perform significantly better
                   on benchmark language-and-vision tasks. Our results indicate
                   that LMs encode conceptual information structurally similarly
                   to vision-based models, even those that are solely trained on
                   images.",

              nature of Aha! moments, moments when we transition from not
              knowing to suddenly realizing the solution to a problem. In this
              work, we present a theoretical framework that explains why we
              experience Aha! moments. Our theory posits that during
              problem-solving, in addition to solving the problem, people also
              maintain a metacognitive model of their ability to solve the
              problem as well as a prediction about the time it would take them
              to solve that problem. Aha! moments arise when we experience a
              positive error in this metacognitive prediction, i.e. when we
              solve a problem much faster than we expected to solve it. We posit
              that this metacognitive error is analogous to a positive reward
              prediction error thereby explaining why we feel so good after an
              Aha! moment. We provide support to our theory across three

              Aha! moments. These results highlight the importance of

                   reasoning ability from limited examples in which solutions
                   require some ``core knowledge'' of concepts such as objects,
                   goal states, counting, and basic geometry. GPT-4 solves only
                   13/50 of the most straightforward ARC tasks when using
                   textual encodings for their two-dimensional input-output
                   grids. Our failure analysis reveals that GPT-4's capacity to
                   identify objects and reason about them is significantly
                   influenced by the sequential nature of the text that
                   represents an object within a text encoding of a task. To
                   test this hypothesis, we design a new benchmark, the 1D-ARC,
                   which consists of one-dimensional (array-like) tasks that are
                   more conducive to GPT-based reasoning, and where it indeed
                   performs better than on the (2D) ARC. To alleviate this

              is that it depends on a sophisticated ability to perform mental
              simulations. According to this perspective, physical reasoning
              problems are approached by repeatedly simulating relevant aspects
              of a scenario, with noise, and making judgments based on
              aggregation over these simulations. In this paper, we describe
              three core tenets of simulation approaches, theoretical
              commitments that must be present in order for a simulation
              approach to be viable. The identification of these tenets

              is their understanding that people are psychological beings with
              internal, mental states including desire, intention, perception,
              and belief. A full understanding of people as psychological beings
              requires a representational theory of mind (ToM), which is an
              understanding that mental states can faithfully represent reality,
              or misrepresent reality. For the last 35 years, researchers have
              relied on false-belief tasks as the gold standard to test
              children's understanding that beliefs can misrepresent reality. In
              false-belief tasks, children are asked to reason about the
              behavior of agents who have false beliefs about situations.
              Although a large body of evidence indicates that most children
              pass false-belief tasks by the end of the preschool years, the
              evidence we present in this monograph suggests that most children
              do not understand false beliefs or, surprisingly, even true
              beliefs until middle childhood. We argue that young children pass
              false-belief tasks without understanding false beliefs by using
              perceptual access reasoning (PAR). With PAR, children understand
              that seeing leads to knowing in the moment, but not that knowing
              also arises from thinking or persists as memory and belief after
              the situation changes. By the same token, PAR leads children to
              fail true-belief tasks. PAR theory can account for performance on
              other traditional tests of representational ToM and related tasks,
              and can account for the factors that have been found to correlate
              with or affect both true- and false-belief performance. The theory
              provides a new laboratory measure which we label the belief
              understanding scale (BUS). This scale can distinguish between a
              child who is operating with PAR versus a child who is
              understanding beliefs. This scale provides a method needed to
              allow the study of the development of representational ToM. In
              this monograph, we report the outcome of the tests that we have
              conducted of predictions generated by PAR theory. The findings
              demonstrated signature PAR limitations in reasoning about the mind
              during the ages when children are hypothesized to be using PAR. In
              Chapter II, secondary analyses of the published true-belief
              literature revealed that children failed several types of
              true-belief tasks. Chapters III through IX describe new empirical
              data collected across multiple studies between 2003 and 2014 from
              580 children aged 4-7 years, as well as from a small sample of 14
              adults. Participants were recruited from the Phoenix, Arizona
              metropolitan area. All participants were native English-speakers.
              Children were recruited from university-sponsored and community
              preschools and daycare centers, and from hospital maternity wards.
              Adults were university students who participated to partially
              fulfill course requirements for research participation.
              Sociometric data were collected only in Chapter IX, and are fully
              reported there. In Chapter III, minor alterations in task
              procedures produced wide variations in children's performance in
              3-option false-belief tasks. In Chapter IV, we report findings
              which show that the developmental lag between children's
              understanding ignorance and understanding false belief is longer
              than the lag reported in previous studies. In Chapter V, children
              did not distinguish between agents who have false beliefs versus
              agents who have no beliefs. In Chapter VI, findings showed that
              children found it no easier to reason about true beliefs than to
              reason about false beliefs. In Chapter VII, when children were
              asked to justify their correct answers in false-belief tasks, they
              did not reference agents' false beliefs. Similarly, in Chapter
              VIII, when children were asked to explain agents' actions in
              false-belief tasks, they did not reference agents' false beliefs.
              In Chapter IX, children who were identified as using PAR differed
              from children who understood beliefs along three dimensions-in
              levels of social development, inhibitory control, and kindergarten
              adjustment. Although the findings need replication and additional
              studies of alternative interpretations, the collection of results
              reported in this monograph challenges the prevailing view that
              representational ToM is in place by the end of the preschool
              years. Furthermore, the pattern of findings is consistent with the
              proposal that PAR is the developmental precursor of
              representational ToM. The current findings also raise questions
              about claims that infants and toddlers demonstrate ToM-related
              abilities, and that representational ToM is innate.",

              place cells suggests that the representation is not purely

              form of a predictive representation. This representation captures
              many aspects of place cell responses that fall outside the
              traditional view of a cognitive map. Furthermore, we argue that
              entorhinal grid cells encode a low-dimensionality basis set for
              the predictive representation, useful for suppressing noise in
              predictions and extracting multiscale structure for hierarchical
              planning.",

               the quantitative knowledge used by engineers and scientists. The
               key to qualitative physics is to find ways to represent
               continuous properties of the world by discrete systems of
               symbols. One can always quantize something continuous, but not
               all quantizations are equally useful. One way to state the idea
               is the relevance principle: The distinctions made by a
               quantization must be relevant to the kind of reasoning performed.

  abstract = "The most exciting hypothesis in cognitive science right now is the
              theory that cognition is embodied. Like all good ideas in
              cognitive science, however, embodiment immediately came to mean
              six different things. The most common definitions involve the
              straight-forward claim that ``states of the body modify states of
              the mind.'' However, the implications of embodiment are actually
              much more radical than this. If cognition can span the brain,
              body, and the environment, then the ``states of mind'' of
              disembodied cognitive science won't exist to be modified.
              Cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a
              broad array of resources. Taking embodiment seriously therefore
              requires both new methods and theory. Here we outline four key
              steps that research programs should follow in order to fully
              engage with the implications of embodiment. The first step is to
              conduct a task analysis, which characterizes from a first person
              perspective the specific task that a perceiving-acting cognitive
              agent is faced with. The second step is to identify the
              task-relevant resources the agent has access to in order to solve
              the task. These resources can span brain, body, and environment.
              The third step is to identify how the agent can assemble these
              resources into a system capable of solving the problem at hand.
              The last step is to test the agent's performance to confirm that
              agent is actually using the solution identified in step 3. We
              explore these steps in more detail with reference to two useful
              examples (the outfielder problem and the A-not-B error), and
              introduce how to apply this analysis to the thorny question of
              language use. Embodied cognition is more than we think it is, and

  abstract  = "Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the
               question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very
               important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its
               effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial
               representation). The current report develops a proposal along
               these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the
               use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a
               dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed
               back to themselves; the internal representations which develop
               thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal
               states. A set of simulations is reported which range from
               relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to
               discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks
               are able to learn interesting internal representations which
               incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this
               approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task
               processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which
               allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing
               generalizations across classes of items. These representations
               suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the

               intelligence. To facilitate research addressing this problem, we
               propose a new testbed that requires an agent to reason about
               physical scenarios and take an action appropriately. Inspired by
               the physical knowledge acquired in infancy and the capabilities
               required for robots to operate in real-world environments, we
               identify 15 essential physical scenarios. We create a wide
               variety of distinct task templates, and we ensure that all the
               task templates within the same scenario can be solved by using
               one specific strategic physical rule. By having such a design, we
               evaluate two distinct levels of generalization, namely local
               generalization and broad generalization. We conduct an extensive
               evaluation with human players, learning agents with various input
               types and architectures, and heuristic agents with different
               strategies. Inspired by how the human intelligence quotient is
               calculated, we define the physical reasoning quotient (Phy-Q
               score) that reflects the physical reasoning intelligence of an
               agent using the physical scenarios we considered. Our evaluation
               shows that (1) all the agents are far below human performance,
               and (2) learning agents, even with good local generalization
               ability, struggle to learn the underlying physical reasoning
               rules and fail to generalize broadly. We encourage the

               Phy-Q score. When it comes to reasoning about the motion of
               physical objects, humans have natural intuitive physics
               knowledge. To test how good artificial learning agents are in
               similar predictive abilities, Xue and colleagues present a

                   interact with one another. To partition images into entities,
                   deep-learning researchers have proposed structural inductive
                   biases such as slot-based architectures. To model
                   interactions among entities, equivariant graph neural nets
                   (GNNs) are used, but these are not particularly well suited
                   to the task for two reasons. First, GNNs do not predispose
                   interactions to be sparse, as relationships among independent
                   entities are likely to be. Second, GNNs do not factorize
                   knowledge about interactions in an entity-conditional manner.
                   As an alternative, we take inspiration from cognitive science
                   and resurrect a classic approach, production systems, which
                   consist of a set of rule templates that are applied by
                   binding placeholder variables in the rules to specific

                   the best fitting rules are applied to update entity
                   properties. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
                   this architecture achieves a flexible, dynamic flow of
                   control and serves to factorize entity-specific and

              might outperform another. We present a series of real-time,
              multi-player experiments asking participants to teach concepts
              using either demonstrations or language. Our first experiment
              (N=416) asks when language might outperform demonstration. We
              manipulate the complexity of the concept being taught and find
              that language communicates complex concepts more effectively than
              demonstration. We then ask why language succeeds in this setting.
              We hypothesized that language allowed teachers to reference
              abstract object features (e.g., shapes and colors), while
              demonstration teachers could only provide concrete examples
              (specific positive or negative objects). To test this hypothesis,
              our second experiment (N=568) ablated object features from the
              teacher's interface. This manipulation severely impaired
              linguistic (but not demonstrative) teaching. Our findings suggest
              that language communicates complex concepts by directly
              transmitting abstract rules. In contrast, demonstrations transmit
              examples, requiring the learner to infer the rules.",

              Conaway and Kurtz (Conaway and Kurtz, Psychonomic Bulletin \&
              Review 24:1312–1323, 2017) reported results from a novel paradigm
              in which participants learned rule-described categories defined
              over two dimensions and then classified test items in distant
              transfer regions of the category space. The paradigm yielded
              results that challenged the predictions from both exemplar-based
              and logical-rule-based models of categorization but that the
              authors suggested were as predicted by a divergent auto-encoder
              (DIVA) model (Kurtz, Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review 14:560–576,
              2007, Kurtz, Psychology of learning and motivation, Academic
              Press, New York, 2015). In this article, we pursue these
              challenges by conducting replications and extensions of the
              original experiment and fitting a variety of computational models
              to the resulting data. We find that even an extended version of
              the exemplar model that makes allowance for learning-during-test
              (LDT) processes fails to account for the results. In addition,
              models that presume a mixture of salient logical rules also fail
              to account for the findings. However, as a proof of concept, we
              illustrate that a model that assumes a mixture of strategies
              across subjects—some relying on exemplar-based memories with LDT,
              and others on salient logical rules—provides an outstanding
              account of the data. By comparison, DIVA performs considerably
              worse than does this LDT-exemplar-rule mixture account. These
              results converge with past ones reported in the literature that
              point to multiple forms of category representation as well as to
              the role of LDT processes in influencing how observers generalize

              initial search through the faulty problem space that may lead to
              impasse; and a postimpasse restructuring phase. Some theories
              propose that the restructuring phase involves controlled search
              processes, whereas other theories propose that restructuring is
              achieved through the automatic redistribution of activation in
              long-term memory. In this study, we used correlations between
              working memory (WM) span measures and problem-solving success to
              test the predictions of these different theories. One group of
              participants received a set of insight problems that allowed for a
              large initial faulty search space, whereas another group received
              a matched set that constrained the initial faulty search space in
              order to isolate the restructuring phase of the insightful
              process. The results suggest that increased ability to control

              proposed to explain insight. The representational change theory
              (e.g., G. Knoblich, S. Ohlsson, \& G. E. Rainey, 2001) proposes
              that insight occurs through relaxing self-imposed constraints on a
              problem and by decomposing chunked items in the problem. The
              progress monitoring theory (e.g., J. N. MacGregor, T. C. Ormerod,
              \& E. P. Chronicle, 2001) proposes that insight is only sought
              once it becomes apparent that the distance to the goal is
              unachievable in the moves remaining. These 2 theories are tested
              in an unlimited move problem, to which neither theory has
              previously been applied. The results lend support to both, but
              experimental manipulations to the problem suggest that the
              representational change theory is the better indicator of

              sentence, and subsequently require time-consuming reanalysis to
              reconstruct a discarded parse. A more recent proposal argues that
              the garden-path effect can be reduced to surprisal arising in a
              fully parallel parser: words consistent with the initially
              dispreferred but ultimately correct parse are simply less
              predictable than those consistent with the incorrect parse. Since
              predictability has pervasive effects in reading far beyond
              garden-path sentences, this account, which dispenses with
              reanalysis mechanisms, is more parsimonious. Crucially, it
              predicts a linear effect of surprisal: the garden-path effect is
              expected to be proportional to the difference in word surprisal
              between the ultimately correct and ultimately incorrect

              reading times, and used that quantity to predict syntactic
              disambiguation difficulty. Surprisal successfully predicted the

              their magnitude, and failed to predict their relative severity

                   when the structure is disambiguated in favor of the less
                   preferred alternative. Surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy,
                   2008), a prominent explanation of this finding, proposes that
                   these slowdowns are due to the unpredictability of each of
                   the words that occur in these sentences. Challenging this

                   garden path effects. In this work, we consider whether this
                   underestimation is due to the fact that humans weight
                   syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than

                   to weigh the cost of lexical and syntactic predictability

                   independently from lexical predictability indeed results in
                   larger estimates of garden path. At the same time, even when
                   syntactic predictability is independently weighted, surprisal
                   still greatly underestimate the magnitude of human garden
                   path effects. Our results support the hypothesis that

  abstract = "The dominant paradigm of experiments in the social and behavioral
              sciences views an experiment as a test of a theory, where the
              theory is assumed to generalize beyond the experiment's specific
              conditions. According to this view, which Alan Newell once
              characterized as ``playing twenty questions with nature,'' theory
              is advanced one experiment at a time, and the integration of
              disparate findings is assumed to happen via the scientific
              publishing process. In this article, we argue that the process of
              integration is at best inefficient, and at worst it does not, in
              fact, occur. We further show that the challenge of integration
              cannot be adequately addressed by recently proposed reforms that
              focus on the reliability and replicability of individual findings,
              nor simply by conducting more or larger experiments. Rather, the
              problem arises from the imprecise nature of social and behavioral
              theories and, consequently, a lack of commensurability across
              experiments conducted under different conditions. Therefore,
              researchers must fundamentally rethink how they design experiments
              and how the experiments relate to theory. We specifically describe
              an alternative framework, integrative experiment design, which
              intrinsically promotes commensurability and continuous integration
              of knowledge. In this paradigm, researchers explicitly map the
              design space of possible experiments associated with a given
              research question, embracing many potentially relevant theories
              rather than focusing on just one. The researchers then iteratively
              generate theories and test them with experiments explicitly
              sampled from the design space, allowing results to be integrated
              across experiments. Given recent methodological and technological
              developments, we conclude that this approach is feasible and would
              generate more-reliable, more-cumulative empirical and theoretical
              knowledge than the current paradigm-and with far greater
              efficiency.",

               web of thoughts and ideas? This research integrates psychological
               work on insight with graph theoretic work on ``small-world''

               directed search, results in a ``shortcut'' in an individual's
               network of representations. This causes a rapid decrease in path

              methods mimics a central aspect of human sentence processing,
              namely the storing of grammatical number and gender information in
              working memory and its use in long-distance agreement (e.g.,
              capturing the correct number agreement between subject and verb
              when they are separated by other phrases). Although the network, a
              recurrent architecture with Long Short-Term Memory units, was
              solely trained to predict the next word in a large corpus,
              analysis showed the emergence of a very sparse set of specialized
              units that successfully handled local and long-distance syntactic
              agreement for grammatical number. However, the simulations also
              showed that this mechanism does not support full recursion and
              fails with some long-range embedded dependencies. We tested the
              model's predictions in a behavioral experiment where humans
              detected violations in number agreement in sentences with
              systematic variations in the singular/plural status of multiple

              were remarkably similar, showing that the model echoes various
              effects observed in human data. However, a key difference was
              that, with embedded long-range dependencies, humans remained above
              chance level, while the model's systematic errors brought it below
              chance. Overall, our study shows that exploring the ways in which

                   recursively nested grammatical structures. Prior work has
                   suggested that language models cannot handle these structures
                   as reliably as humans can. However, the humans were provided
                   with instructions and training before being evaluated, while
                   the language models were evaluated zero-shot. I therefore
                   attempt to more closely match the evaluation paradigms by
                   providing language models with few-shot prompts. A simple
                   prompt, which contains substantially less content than the
                   human training, allows large language models to consistently
                   outperform the human results. The same prompt even allows
                   extrapolation to more deeply nested conditions than have been
                   tested in humans. Further, a reanalysis of the prior human
                   experiments suggests that the humans may not perform above
                   chance at the difficult structures initially. These results
                   suggest that large language models can in fact process
                   recursively nested grammatical structures comparably to
                   humans. This case study highlights how discrepancies in the
                   quantity of experiment-specific context can confound
                   comparisons of language models and humans. I use this case
                   study to reflect on the broader challenge of comparing human
                   and model capabilities, and to suggest that there is an
                   important difference between evaluating cognitive models of a
                   specific phenomenon and evaluating broadly-trained models.",

               Craik, and the idea that redundancy is important for
               understanding perception (Attneave 1954), the physiology of
               sensory pathways (Barlow 1959), and pattern recognition (Watanabe

               Some of this knowledge can be obtained by observations of mean,
               variance, and covariance of sensory messages, and perhaps also by
               a method called “minimum entropy coding.” (3) Such knowledge may
               be incorporated in a model of “what usually happens” with which
               incoming messages are automatically compared, enabling unexpected
               discrepancies to be immediately identified. (4) Knowledge of the
               sort incorporated into such a filter is a necessary prerequisite
               of ordinary learning, and a representation whose elements are
               independent makes it possible to form associations with logical

              learning operates implicitly, without instruction, through mere

              must acquire about a structured domain consists of principles or

              instance-learning and generalization is based on two factors: the

              because plans must often be made in complex environments, and yet
              people successfully plan solutions to many everyday problems
              despite having limited cognitive resources1-3. Standard accounts
              in psychology, economics and artificial intelligence have

              the unconscious mechanism of problem solving during insight tasks
              is a Darwinian process. It is based on the evolution of patterns
              that represent candidate solutions to a problem, and are stored

              experiment, we used human data as a benchmark and showed that the
              model behaves comparably to humans: it shows an improvement in
              performance if it is pretrained and primed appropriately, just
              like human participants in Kershaw et al. (2013)'s experiment. In

              a unique nesting behavior assay, we confirmed a ``critical
              period'' for developing music preference in C57BL/6 mice. Early
              music exposure between postnatal days 15 and 24 reversed their
              innate bias for silent shelter, which typically could not be
              altered in adulthood. Instead, exposing adult mice treated acutely
              with valproic acid or carrying a targeted deletion of the Nogo
              receptor (NgR(-/-)) unmasked a strong plasticity of preference
              consistent with a reopening of the critical period as seen in
              other systems. Imaging of cFos expression revealed a prominent
              neuronal activation in response to the exposed music in the
              prelimbic and infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex only under
              conditions of open plasticity. Neither behavioral changes nor

              between performance and competence-to encourage ``species-fair''
              comparisons between humans and machines. The
              performance/competence distinction urges us to consider whether
              the failure of a system to behave as ideally hypothesized, or the
              failure of one creature to behave like another, arises not because
              the system lacks the relevant knowledge or internal capacities
              (``competence''), but instead because of superficial constraints
              on demonstrating that knowledge (``performance''). I argue that
              this distinction has been neglected by research comparing human
              and machine behavior, and that it should be essential to any such
              comparison. Focusing on the domain of image classification, I
              identify three factors contributing to the species-fairness of
              human-machine comparisons, extracted from recent work that equates
              such constraints. Species-fair comparisons level the playing field
              between natural and artificial intelligence, so that we can

              disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally
              building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental
              decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent
              information processing units which must interface with each other
              via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed
              into independent and parallel activity producers which all
              interface directly to the world through perception and action,
              rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions
              of central and peripheral systems evaporate—everything is both
              central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a
              very successful series of mobile robots which operate without

              variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures
              that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally
              independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is
              therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in

                   However, inducing language model rationale generation
                   currently requires either constructing massive rationale
                   datasets or sacrificing accuracy by using only few-shot
                   inference. We propose a technique to iteratively leverage a
                   small number of rationale examples and a large dataset
                   without rationales, to bootstrap the ability to perform
                   successively more complex reasoning. This technique, the
                   ``Self-Taught Reasoner'' (STaR), relies on a simple loop:
                   generate rationales to answer many questions, prompted with a
                   few rationale examples; if the generated answers are wrong,
                   try again to generate a rationale given the correct answer;
                   fine-tune on all the rationales that ultimately yielded
                   correct answers; repeat. We show that STaR significantly
                   improves performance on multiple datasets compared to a model
                   fine-tuned to directly predict final answers, and performs
                   comparably to fine-tuning a 30$\times$ larger
                   state-of-the-art language model on CommensenseQA. Thus, STaR
                   lets a model improve itself by learning from its own

                   our abstract plans to fit the scene. Embodied agents require
                   the same abilities, but existing work does not yet provide
                   the infrastructure necessary for both reasoning abstractly
                   and executing concretely. We address this limitation by
                   introducing ALFWorld, a simulator that enables agents to
                   learn abstract, text based policies in TextWorld (C\^ot\'e et

                   task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in
                   calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can
                   leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via
                   heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While
                   adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective,
                   such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric
                   external modules to expand their context processing ability,

              synthesis on the basis of internal knowledge representation by the
              object–attribute-relation (OAR) model. Problem solving is a
              cognitive process of the brain that searches a solution for a
              given problem or finds a path to reach a given goal. When a

              a search process in the memory space for finding a relationship

              offer a new, principled interpretation of behavior, and previous
              experiments and theories can inform many unexplored aspects of the
              Bayesian enterprise. Here we consider one such issue: the finding
              that surprising events provoke animals to learn faster. We suggest
              that, in a statistical account of conditioning, surprise signals
              change and therefore uncertainty and the need for new learning. We
              discuss inference in a world that changes and show how
              experimental results involving surprise can be interpreted from
              this perspective, and also how, thus understood, these phenomena
              help constrain statistical theories of animal and human learning.",

  abstract = "Decision making in an uncertain environment poses a conflict
              between the opposing demands of gathering and exploiting
              information. In a classic illustration of this
              'exploration-exploitation' dilemma, a gambler choosing between
              multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems,
              on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option,
              against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might
              turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide information for
              improving future decisions). Far from representing idle curiosity,
              such exploration is often critical for organisms to discover how
              best to harvest resources such as food and water. In appetitive
              choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned by
              computational reinforcement learning (RL) theory, indicates that a
              dopaminergic, striatal and medial prefrontal network mediates
              learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration has been
              well studied from both theoretical and ethological perspectives,
              its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we show, in a
              gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be characterized
              by a computationally well-regarded strategy for addressing the
              explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this characterization
              to classify decisions as exploratory or exploitative, we employ
              functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the frontopolar
              cortex and intraparietal sulcus are preferentially active during
              exploratory decisions. In contrast, regions of striatum and
              ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit activity characteristic of
              an involvement in value-based exploitative decision making. The
              results suggest a model of action selection under uncertainty that
              involves switching between exploratory and exploitative
              behavioural modes, and provide a computationally precise
              characterization of the contribution of key decision-related brain
              systems to each of these functions.",

                   occurs in artificial neural networks trained with gradient
                   descent algorithms. We compared learning dynamics in humans
                   and regularised neural networks in a perceptual decision task
                   that provided a hidden opportunity which allowed to solve the

                   this regularity through insight, rather than gradually.
                   Notably, neural networks with regularised gate modulation

                   revealed that insight-like behaviour crucially depended on
                   noise added to gradient updates, and was preceded by ``silent
                   knowledge'' that is initially suppressed by regularised
                   (attentional) gating. This suggests that insights can arise

              natural language processing, but they are typically trained on
              orders of magnitude more language input than children receive.
              What can these neural networks, which are primarily distributional
              learners, learn from a naturalistic subset of a single child's
              experience? We examine this question using a recent longitudinal
              dataset collected from a single child, consisting of egocentric
              visual data paired with text transcripts. We train both
              language-only and vision-and-language neural networks and analyze
              the linguistic knowledge they acquire. In parallel with findings
              from Elman's (1990) seminal work, the neural networks form
              emergent clusters of words corresponding to syntactic (nouns,
              transitive and intransitive verbs) and semantic categories (e.g.,
              animals and clothing), based solely on one child's linguistic
              input. The networks also acquire sensitivity to acceptability
              contrasts from linguistic phenomena such as determiner-noun
              agreement and argument structure. We find that incorporating
              visual information produces an incremental gain in predicting
              words in context, especially for syntactic categories that are
              comparatively more easily grounded such as nouns and verbs, but
              the underlying linguistic representations are not fundamentally
              altered. Our findings demonstrate which kinds of linguistic
              knowledge are learnable from a snapshot of a single child's real
              developmental experience, and which kinds may benefit from
              stronger inductive biases or richer sources of data.",

               typically consisting of images or videos paired with spoken

               correlations with non-semantic aspects of the speech signal. Here

                   we provide an in-depth review of the role of Bayesian methods
                   for the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. The major
                   incentives for incorporating Bayesian reasoning in RL are: 1)
                   it provides an elegant approach to action-selection
                   (exploration/exploitation) as a function of the uncertainty

                   and methods for Bayesian inference in the simple single-step

              effects of context and experience on the representations people
              use is essential, because if two people encode the same stimulus
              using different representations, their response to that stimulus
              may be different. We present a computational framework that can be
              used to define models that flexibly construct feature
              representations (where by a feature we mean a part of the image of
              an object) for a set of observed objects, based on nonparametric
              Bayesian statistics. Austerweil and Griffiths (2011) presented an
              initial model constructed in this framework that captures how the
              distribution of parts affects the features people use to represent
              a set of objects. We build on this work in three ways. First,
              although people use features that can be transformed on each
              observation (e.g., translate on the retinal image), many existing
              feature learning models can only recognize features that are not
              transformed (occur identically each time). Consequently, we extend
              the initial model to infer features that are invariant over a set
              of transformations, and learn different structures of dependence
              between feature transformations. Second, we compare two possible
              methods for capturing the manner that categorization affects
              feature representations. Finally, we present a model that learns
              features incrementally, capturing an effect of the order of object
              presentation on the features people learn. We conclude by
              considering the implications and limitations of our empirical and
              theoretical results.",

                   natural language processing, such as planning and interaction
                   for robots. These embodied problems require an agent to
                   understand many semantic aspects of the world: the repertoire
                   of skills available, how these skills influence the world,
                   and how changes to the world map back to the language. LLMs
                   planning in embodied environments need to consider not just
                   what skills to do, but also how and when to do them - answers
                   that change over time in response to the agent's own choices.
                   In this work, we investigate to what extent LLMs used in such
                   embodied contexts can reason over sources of feedback

              learn from? Recent studies suggest it may be possible to learn
              more novel concepts than the number of examples. Previous
              approaches to such less-than-one-shot (LO-shot) learning used soft
              labels to provide weighted mappings from each example to multiple
              categories. Unfortunately, people find soft labels unintuitive and
              this approach did not provide plausible, cognitively-grounded
              mechanisms for LO-shot learning at scale. We propose a new
              paradigm that leverages well-established learning strategies:
              reducing complex stimuli to primitives, learning by
              discrimination, and generalizing to novel compositions of
              features. We show that participants can learn 22 categories from

                   user-specified heuristic. To ensure that these generators'
                   output is sufficiently diverse (that is, not amounting to the
                   reproduction of a single optimal level configuration), the
                   generation process is constrained such that the initial seed
                   results in some variance in the generator's output. However,
                   this results in a loss of control over the generated content

                   generalisation of behaviour to a massive, rich space of
                   challenges. We define a universe of tasks within an

                   agents that are generally capable across this vast space and
                   beyond. The environment is natively multi-agent, spanning the
                   continuum of competitive, cooperative, and independent games,
                   which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D

                   of the challenges posed to agents, and as such, even
                   measuring the learning progress of an agent is an open
                   research problem. We propose an iterative notion of
                   improvement between successive generations of agents, rather
                   than seeking to maximise a singular objective, allowing us to
                   quantify progress despite tasks being incomparable in terms
                   of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing an
                   open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the
                   training task distributions and training objectives such that
                   the agent never stops learning, we achieve consistent
                   learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able to
                   score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation

                   generalisation include good performance on Hide and Seek,
                   Capture the Flag, and Tag. Through analysis and hand-authored
                   probe tasks we characterise the behaviour of our agent, and
                   find interesting emergent heuristic behaviours such as
                   trial-and-error experimentation, simple tool use, option
                   switching, and cooperation. Finally, we demonstrate that the

                   We implement five compositional language models to probe the

                   novel training algorithm, Compositional Skipgram for Images

                   particular combination of attribute and object (such as ``red

              of learning, but which suddenly had reward introduced in the
              latter part of learning, and a control group which received reward
              throughout the whole of learning. The answer to the question as to
              the efficiency of non-reward units of practice was sought in a
              comparison of the learning curve of the experimental group (both
              before and after the introduction of reward) with that of the
              control group.'' Three mazes were used, two with ordinary blinds
              and one with blinds arranged so that the animal could go two ways
              as well as having as alternatives a long and a short path. ``They
              prevented retracings from one section of the maze to another, they
              were noiseless, and they caused no excitement in the animals.''
              There were 36 rats in each group. The results show that: ``(1)
              Rats run under a non-reward condition learned much more slowly
              than rats run under a reward condition.'' ``(2) Rats previously
              run under a non-reward condition, when suddenly rewarded made a
              great improvement.'' ``(3) During the non-reward period, the rats
              were developing a latent learning of the maze which they were able
              to utilize as soon as reward was introduced.'' ``(5) It was
              demonstrated by the use of the two-path maze that the latent
              learning which was developed under non-reward conditions and was
              made manifest as soon as reward was introduced was not the result
              of any very consistently greater frequency of the correct over the
              incorrect path during the non-reward period.'' Bibliography and

              with the context-dependent representation of complex memories, the
              role of mental exploration based on imagined rather than real
              movements, and the use of recalled information for navigation and
              decision-making. The progress that has been made in understanding
              the hippocampus has motivated the study of other brain regions

              Shiffrin, 1990), the mirror effect (e.g., Glanzer \& Adams, 1990),
              and the normal-ROC slope effect (e.g., Ratcliff, McKoon, \&
              Tindall, 1994). The model assumes storage of separate episodic
              images for different words, each image consisting of a vector of
              feature values. Each image is an incomplete and error prone copy
              of the studied vector. For the simplest case, it is possible to
              calculate the probability that a test item is ``old,'' and it is
              assumed that a default ``old'' response is given if this
              probability is greater than .5. It is demonstrated that this model
              and its more complete and realistic versions produce excellent

                   However, inducing language model rationale generation
                   currently requires either constructing massive rationale
                   datasets or sacrificing accuracy by using only few-shot
                   inference. We propose a technique to iteratively leverage a
                   small number of rationale examples and a large dataset
                   without rationales, to bootstrap the ability to perform
                   successively more complex reasoning. This technique, the
                   ``Self-Taught Reasoner'' (STaR), relies on a simple loop:
                   generate rationales to answer many questions, prompted with a
                   few rationale examples; if the generated answers are wrong,
                   try again to generate a rationale given the correct answer;
                   fine-tune on all the rationales that ultimately yielded
                   correct answers; repeat. We show that STaR significantly
                   improves performance on multiple datasets compared to a model
                   fine-tuned to directly predict final answers, and performs
                   comparably to fine-tuning a 30$\times$ larger
                   state-of-the-art language model on CommensenseQA. Thus, STaR

  abstract = "Some neurons in deep networks specialize in recognizing highly
              specific perceptual, structural, or semantic features of inputs.
              In computer vision, techniques exist for identifying neurons that
              respond to individual concept categories like colors, textures,
              and object classes. But these techniques are limited in scope,
              labeling only a small subset of neurons and behaviors in any
              network. Is a richer characterization of neuron-level computation
              possible? We introduce a procedure (called MILAN, for mutual
              information-guided linguistic annotation of neurons) that
              automatically labels neurons with open-ended, compositional,
              natural language descriptions. Given a neuron, MILAN generates a
              description by searching for a natural language string that
              maximizes pointwise mutual information with the image regions in
              which the neuron is active. MILAN produces fine-grained
              descriptions that capture categorical, relational, and logical
              structure in learned features. These descriptions obtain high
              agreement with human-generated feature descriptions across a
              diverse set of model architectures and tasks, and can aid in
              understanding and controlling learned models. We highlight three
              applications of natural language neuron descriptions. First, we
              use MILAN for analysis, characterizing the distribution and
              importance of neurons selective for attribute, category, and
              relational information in vision models. Second, we use MILAN for
              auditing, surfacing neurons sensitive to human faces in datasets
              designed to obscure them. Finally, we use MILAN for editing,
              improving robustness in an image classifier by deleting neurons
              sensitive to text features spuriously correlated with class
              labels.",

                   In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational
                   software agents that simulate believable human behavior.
                   Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work;
                   artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions,
                   notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember
                   and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable
                   generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a
                   large language model to store a complete record of the
                   agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those
                   memories over time into higher-level reflections, and
                   retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate
                   generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox
                   environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can
                   interact with a small town of twenty five agents using
                   natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents
                   produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors:
                   for example, starting with only a single user-specified
                   notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party,
                   the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over
                   the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out
                   on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the
                   party together at the right time. We demonstrate through
                   ablation that the components of our agent
                   architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each
                   contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior.
                   By fusing large language models with computational,
                   interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and
                   interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of

                   attributes. The training experiences of language models

                   conditioning on a question and selecting the answer with the
                   highest probability. However, ranking by string probability
                   can be problematic due to surface form competition-wherein
                   different surface forms compete for probability mass, even if
                   they represent the same underlying concept, e.g. ``computer''
                   and ``PC.'' Since probability mass is finite, this lowers the
                   probability of the correct answer, due to competition from
                   other strings that are valid answers (but not one of the

              synonymous with Bayesian modelling, which simply uses the rules of

               objects and can remember the purpose they have been made for but
               do not know the way in which they must be used to achieve that
               purpose. Knowledge about the use of objects and tools can have
               two sources: It can be based on retrieval of instructions of use
               from semantic memory or on a direct inference of function from
               structure. The ability to infer function from structure enables
               subjects to use unfamiliar tools and to detect alternative uses
               of familiar tools. It is the basis of mechanical problem solving.
               The purpose of the present study was to analyze retrieval of
               instruction of use, mechanical problem solving, and actual tool
               use in patients with apraxia due to circumscribed lesions of the
               left hemisphere. For assessing mechanical problem solving we
               developed a test of selection and application of novel tools.
               Access to instruction of use was tested by pantomime of tool use.
               Actual tool use was examined for the same familiar tools. Forty
               two patients with left brain damage (LBD) and aphasia, 22
               patients with right brain damage (RBD) and 22 controls were
               examined. Only LBD patients differed from controls on all tests.
               RBD patients had difficulties with the use but not with the
               selection of novel tools. In LBD patients there was a significant
               correlation between pantomime of tool use and novel tool
               selection but there were single cases who scored in the defective
               range on one of these tests and normally on the other. Analysis
               of LBD patients' lesions suggested that frontal lobe damage does
               not disturb novel tool selection. Only LBD patients who failed on
               pantomime of object use and on novel tool selection committed
               errors in actual use of familiar tools. The finding that
               mechanical problem solving is invariably defective in apraxic
               patients who commit errors with familiar tools is in good accord
               with clinical observations, as the gravity of their errors goes
               beyond what one would expect as a mere sequel of loss of access

              displacement, and retroactive interference. Another account of
              recency is based on the idea of variable context (Estes, 1955;
              Mensink \& Raaijmakers, 1989). Such notions are typically cast in
              terms of a randomly fluctuating population of elements reflective
              of subtle changes in the environment or in the subjects' mental
              state. This random context view has recently been incorporated
              into distributed and neural network memory models (Murdock, 1997;
              Murdock, Smith, \& Bai, 2001). Here we propose an alternative
              model. Rather than being driven by random fluctuations, this
              formulation, the temporal context model (TCM), uses retrieval of
              prior contextual states to drive contextual drift. In TCM,
              retrieved context is an inherently asymmetric retrieval cue. This
              allows the model to provide a principled explanation of the
              widespread advantage for forward recalls in free and serial
              recall. Modeling data from single-trial free recall, we
              demonstrate that TCM can simultaneously explain recency and

               al. (Brain 1991; 114: 727-41) provides support for the latter

              and selection among random local mutations and recombinations of
              (parts of) one's current model. We argue that, by narrowing and

              In a selection task, the learner actively chooses observations to

              passively encountered. People routinely use both forms of testing
              in everyday life, but the critical psychological differences
              between selection and reception learning remain poorly understood.
              One hypothesis is that selection learning improves learning
              performance by enhancing generic cognitive processes related to
              motivation, attention, and engagement. Alternatively, we suggest
              that differences between these 2 learning modes derives from a
              hypothesis-dependent sampling bias that is introduced when a
              person collects data to test his or her own individual hypothesis.
              Drawing on influential models of sequential hypothesis-testing

  abstract = "The particle filter was popularized in the early 1990s and has
              been used for solving estimation problems ever since. The standard
              algorithm can be understood and implemented with limited effort
              due to the widespread availability of tutorial material and code
              examples. Extensive research has advanced the standard particle
              filter algorithm to improve its performance and applicability in
              various ways in the years after. As a result, selecting and
              implementing an advanced version of the particle filter that goes
              beyond the standard algorithm and fits a specific estimation
              problem requires either a thorough understanding or reviewing
              large amounts of the literature. The latter can be heavily time
              consuming especially for those with limited hands-on experience.
              Lack of implementation details in theory-oriented papers
              complicates this task even further. The goal of this tutorial is
              facilitating the reader to familiarize themselves with the key
              concepts of advanced particle filter algorithms and to select and
              implement the right particle filter for the estimation problem at
              hand. It acts as a single entry point that provides a theoretical
              overview of the filter, its assumptions and solutions for various
              challenges encountered when applying particle filters. Besides
              that, it includes a running example that demonstrates and

  abstract = "Many students are being left behind by an educational system that
              some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes
              will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this
              monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students
              to better regulate their learning through the use of effective
              learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational
              psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use
              learning techniques that could help students achieve their
              learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning
              techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their
              relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be
              relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many
              students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading)
              were selected because students report relying heavily on them,
              which makes it especially important to examine how well they work.
              The techniques include elaborative interrogation,
              self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining),
              the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading,
              practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice.
              To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these
              techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across
              four categories of variables: learning conditions, student
              characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning
              conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which
              the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies
              alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables
              such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary
              from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated
              science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures
              that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping
              memory, problem solving, and comprehension. We attempted to
              provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is
              rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular
              fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is
              divided into the following sections: General description of the
              technique and why it should work How general are the effects of
              this technique? 2a. Learning conditions 2b. Student
              characteristics 2c. Materials 2d. Criterion tasks Effects in
              representative educational contexts Issues for implementation
              Overall assessment The review for each technique can be read
              independently of the others, and particular variables of interest
              can be easily compared across techniques. To foreshadow our final
              recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their
              generalizability and promise for improving student learning.
              Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility
              assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and
              abilities and have been shown to boost students' performance
              across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts.
              Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved
              practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of
              these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite
              their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment
              because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance,
              elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been
              adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of
              interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so the
              ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown.
              Nevertheless, the techniques that received moderate-utility
              ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in
              appropriate situations, which we describe in detail within the
              review of each technique. Five techniques received a low utility
              assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic,
              imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These techniques
              were rated as low utility for numerous reasons. Summarization and
              imagery use for text learning have been shown to help some
              students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions under which
              these techniques produce benefits are limited, and much research
              is still needed to fully explore their overall effectiveness. The
              keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in some contexts, and
              it appears to benefit students for a limited number of materials
              and for short retention intervals. Most students report rereading
              and highlighting, yet these techniques do not consistently boost
              students' performance, so other techniques should be used in their
              place (e.g., practice testing instead of rereading). Our hope is
              that this monograph will foster improvements in student learning,
              not only by showcasing which learning techniques are likely to
              have the most generalizable effects but also by encouraging
              researchers to continue investigating the most promising
              techniques. Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some
              issues for how these techniques could be implemented by teachers
              and students, and we highlight directions for future research.",

               promoting learning, yet retrieval is not often granted the
               central role it deserves. Learning is typically identified with
               the encoding or construction of knowledge, and retrieval is
               considered merely the assessment of learning that occurred in a
               prior experience. The retrieval-based learning perspective
               outlined here is grounded in the fact that all expressions of
               knowledge involve retrieval and depend on the retrieval cues
               available in a given context. Further, every time a person
               retrieves knowledge, that knowledge is changed, because
               retrieving knowledge improves one?s ability to retrieve it again
               in the future. Practicing retrieval does not merely produce rote,
               transient learning; it produces meaningful, long-term learning.
               Yet retrieval practice is a tool many students lack metacognitive
               awareness of and do not use as often as they should. Active
               retrieval is an effective but undervalued strategy for promoting

                   are extremely sparse, or absent altogether. In such cases,
                   curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable
                   the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that
                   might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as
                   the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of
                   its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a
                   self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation

                   pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the
                   environment that cannot affect the agent. The proposed
                   approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super
                   Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse
                   extrinsic reward, where curiosity allows for far fewer
                   interactions with the environment to reach the goal; 2)
                   exploration with no extrinsic reward, where curiosity pushes
                   the agent to explore more efficiently; and 3) generalization
                   to unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of the same game) where
                   the knowledge gained from earlier experience helps the agent
                   explore new places much faster than starting from scratch.

               information from its samples, whereas the rest (the minor
               bandits) have unobservable rewards. Under the assumption that the

                   debate over whether human cognitive capacities might emerge
                   in such generic models given sufficient training data. Of
                   particular interest is the ability of these models to reason
                   about novel problems zero-shot, without any direct training.
                   In human cognition, this capacity is closely tied to an
                   ability to reason by analogy. Here, we performed a direct
                   comparison between human reasoners and a large language model
                   (the text-davinci-003 variant of GPT-3) on a range of
                   analogical tasks, including a novel text-based matrix
                   reasoning task closely modeled on Raven's Progressive
                   Matrices. We found that GPT-3 displayed a surprisingly strong
                   capacity for abstract pattern induction, matching or even
                   surpassing human capabilities in most settings. Our results
                   indicate that large language models such as GPT-3 have
                   acquired an emergent ability to find zero-shot solutions to a
                   broad range of analogy problems.",

                   performance on code generation. However, for complex
                   programming tasks, generating the correct solution in one go
                   becomes challenging, thus some prior works have designed
                   program repair approaches to improve code generation
                   performance. In this work, we propose Self-Debugging, which
                   teaches a large language model to debug its predicted program
                   via few-shot demonstrations. In particular, we demonstrate
                   that Self-Debugging can teach the large language model to
                   perform rubber duck debugging; i.e., without any feedback on
                   the code correctness or error messages, the model is able to
                   identify its mistakes by explaining the generated code in
                   natural language. Self-Debugging achieves the
                   state-of-the-art performance on several code generation
                   benchmarks, including the Spider dataset for text-to-SQL
                   generation, TransCoder for C++-to-Python translation, and
                   MBPP for text-to-Python generation. On the Spider benchmark
                   where there are no unit tests to verify the correctness of
                   predictions, Self-Debugging with code explanation
                   consistently improves the baseline by 2-3\%, and improves the
                   prediction accuracy on problems of the hardest label by 9\%.
                   On TransCoder and MBPP where unit tests are available,
                   Self-Debugging improves the baseline accuracy by up to 12\%.
                   Meanwhile, by leveraging feedback messages and reusing failed
                   predictions, Self-Debugging notably improves sample
                   efficiency, and can match or outperform baseline models that
                   generate more than 10x candidate programs.",

               understand qualitative reasoning about processes, when they will

              contribution of two separable memory retrieval processes, namely
              recollection and familiarity. However, fundamental questions
              remain regarding the functional nature and neural substrates of
              these processes. In this article, we describe a simple
              quantitative model of recognition memory (i.e., the dual-process
              signal detection model) that has been useful in integrating
              findings from a broad range of cognitive studies, and that is now
              being applied in a growing number of neuroscientific
              investigations of memory. The model makes several strong
              assumptions about the behavioral nature and neural substrates of
              recollection and familiarity. A review of the literature indicates
              that these assumptions are generally well supported, but that
              there are clear boundary conditions in which these assumptions
              break down. We argue that these findings provide important
              insights into the operation of the processes underlying
              recognition. Finally, we consider how the dual-process approach
              relates to recent neuroanatomical and computational models and how

                   collection of few-shot abstraction and analogy problems
                   developed by Chollet [2019]. In particular, we describe

                   domain that systematically assesses abstraction and
                   generalization abilities on a number of basic spatial and
                   semantic concepts. ConceptARC differs from the original ARC
                   dataset in that it is specifically organized around ``concept
                   groups'' -- sets of problems that focus on specific concepts

               born with a brain system that has evolved to support social
               affiliation. However, the evidence does not necessarily support
               this assumption. Alternatively, social animals can be defined as
               those who cannot survive alone and rely on members from their
               group to regulate their ongoing physiology (or allostasis). The
               rather simple evolutionary constraint of social dependency for
               survival can be sufficient to make the social environment vitally
               salient, and to provide the ultimate driving force for socially
               crafted brain development and learning. In this Perspective, we
               propose a framework for sociality and specify a set of hypotheses
               on the mechanisms of social development and underlying neural
               systems. The theoretical shift proposed here implies that
               profound human characteristics, including but not limited to
               sociality, are acquired at an early age, while social
               interactions provide key wiring instructions that determine brain
               development. Human infants need a social environment to survive
               as they rely on caregivers to maintain allostasis. This
               Perspective proposes that the need of others to regulate
               physiological changes determines brain development, not only in
               the social domain.",

              a bowl-grasp. In contrast, infants used a novel tool flexibly and

              3 groups of infants were trained to use the tool differently.
              Later, infants' performance was facilitated on tasks that required

               functional outcome has been brought about (e.g. getting a box

               adult even if the goal of the actions is not realized during
               modelling. A group of 4-year-old participants were presented with
               a toy lying at the bottom of a Perspex tube. Despite the
               availability of a bottle of water, and unlike the responses of a

               influence innovation rates. In the current study, we investigated
               these aspects in the floating peanut task (FPT), which required
               children to pour water into a vertical tube to retrieve a peanut.
               In three experiments, we varied the amount of plants that
               6-year-olds (N = 256) watered prior to the task (zero, one, or
               five plants), who watered the plants (child or experimenter), and
               the distance and salience of the water source. We expected that
               prior experience with the water would modulate task performance
               by either boosting innovation rates (facilitation effect) or
               reducing them given that children would possibly learn that the
               water was for watering plants (functional fixedness effect). Our
               results indicate robustly low innovation rates in 6-year-olds.
               However, children's performance improved to some extent with
               increased salience of the water source as well as with an
               experimenter-given hint. Due to the low innovation rates in this

               FPT would influence innovation rates in 7- and 8-year-olds (N =
               33), for which we did not find evidence. We conclude that
               6-year-olds struggle with innovation but that they are more
               likely to innovate if crucial aspects of the task are made more
               salient. Thus, although 6-year-olds can innovate, they require

  abstract = "Two hallmarks of insightful problem solving are thought to be
              suddenness in the emergence of solution due to changes in problem
              representation, and the subjective Aha! experience. Although a
              number of studies have explored the Aha! experience, few studies
              have attempted to measure representational change. Following the
              lead of Durso et al. (Psychol Sci 5(2):94-97, 1994) and Cushen and
              Wiley (Conscious Cognit 21(3):1166-1175, 2012), in this study,
              participants made importance-to-solution ratings throughout their
              solution attempts as a way to assess representational change.
              Participants viewed a set of magic trick videos with the task of
              finding out how each trick worked, and rated six action verbs for
              each trick (including one that implied the correct solution)
              multiple times during solution. They were also asked to indicate
              the extent to which they experienced an Aha! moment. Patterns of
              ratings that showed a sudden change towards a correct solution led
              to stronger Aha! experiences than patterns that showed a more
              incremental change towards a correct solution, or a change towards
              incorrect solutions. The results show a connection between sudden
              changes in problem representations (leading to correct solutions)
              and the subjective appraisal of solutions as an Aha! experience.
              This offers the first empirical support for a close relationship
              between two theoretical constructs that have traditionally been
              assumed to be related to insightful problem solving.",

               terms of active (Bayesian) inference. It deals with the dual
               problem of inferring states of the world and learning its
               statistical structure. In contrast to current trends in machine
               learning (e.g., deep learning), we focus on how people attain
               insight and understanding using just a handful of observations,
               which are solicited through curious behavior. We use simulations
               of abstract rule learning and approximate Bayesian inference to
               show that minimizing (expected) variational free energy leads to
               active sampling of novel contingencies. This epistemic behavior
               closes explanatory gaps in generative models of the world,
               thereby reducing uncertainty and satisfying curiosity. We then
               move from epistemic learning to model selection or structure
               learning to show how abductive processes emerge when agents test
               plausible hypotheses about symmetries (i.e., invariances or
               rules) in their generative models. The ensuing Bayesian model
               reduction evinces mechanisms associated with sleep and has all
               the hallmarks of ``aha'' moments. This formulation moves toward a
               computational account of consciousness in the pre-Cartesian sense
               of sharable knowledge (i.e., con: ``together''; scire: ``to

               insight is oftentimes vaguely regarded as a special discontinuous
               intellectual process and/or a cognitive restructuring of problem
               representation or goal approach. However, this nearly century-old
               state of art devised by the Gestalt tradition to explain the
               non-analytical or non-trial-and-error, goal-seeking aptitude of
               primate mentality tends to neglect problem-solving capabilities
               of lower animal phyla, Kingdoms other than Animalia, and
               advancing smart computational technologies built from biological,
               artificial, and composite media. Attempting to provide an
               inclusive, precise definition of insight, two major criteria of
               insight, discontinuous processing and problem restructuring, are
               here reframed using terminology and statistical mechanical
               properties of computational complexity classes. Discontinuous
               processing becomes abrupt state transitions in
               algorithmic/heuristic outcomes or in types of
               algorithms/heuristics executed by agents using classical and/or
               quantum computational models. And problem restructuring becomes
               combinatorial reorganization of resources, problem-type
               substitution, and/or exchange of computational models. With
               insight bounded by computational complexity, humans, ciliated
               protozoa, and complex technological networks, for example, show
               insight when restructuring time requirements, combinatorial
               complexity, and problem type to solve polynomial and
               nondeterministic polynomial decision problems. Similar effects
               are expected from other problem types, supporting the idea that
               insight might be an epiphenomenon of analytical problem solving
               and consequently a larger information processing framework. Thus,
               this computational complexity definition of insight improves the
               power, external and internal validity, and reliability of
               operational parameters with which to classify, investigate, and
               produce the phenomenon for computational agents ranging from

              parameters in various IRT models, the most flexible being the ltm
              (Rizopoulos 2006), eRm (Mair and Hatzinger 2007), and MCMCpack
              (Martin, Quinn, and Park 2011) packages. However these packages
              have limitations in that ltm and eRm can only analyze
              unidimensional IRT models effectively and the exploratory
              multidimensional extensions available in MCMCpack requires prior
              understanding of Bayesian estimation convergence diagnostics and
              are computationally intensive. Most importantly, multidimensional
              confirmatory item factor analysis methods have not been
              implemented in any R package. The mirt package was created for
              estimating multidimensional item response theory parameters for
              exploratory and confirmatory models by using maximum-likelihood
              meth- ods. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature method used in traditional

              bifactor models (Gibbons and Hedeker 1992). Exploratory and
              confirmatory models are estimated by a stochastic algorithm
              described by Cai (2010a,b). Various program comparisons are

                   applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to
                   on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad
                   range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra
                   model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these
                   benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve
                   human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark
                   MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the
                   20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new
                   capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning

              complexity in the mind? Intuitively, increasingly complex objects
              and events should give rise to increasingly complex mental
              representations (or perhaps a plateau in complexity after a
              certain point). However, a counterintuitive possibility with roots
              in information theory is an inverted-U-shaped relationship between
              the ``objective'' complexity of some stimulus and the complexity
              of its mental representation, because excessively complex patterns
              might be characterized by surprisingly short computational
              descriptions (e.g., if they are represented as having been
              generated randomly). Here, we demonstrate that this is the case,
              using a novel approach that takes the notion of ``description''
              literally. Subjects saw static and dynamic visual stimuli whose
              objective complexity could be carefully manipulated, and they
              described these stimuli in their own words by giving free-form
              spoken descriptions of them. Across three experiments totaling
              over 10,000 speech clips, spoken descriptions of shapes
              (Experiment 1), dot arrays (Experiment 2), and dynamic motion
              paths (Experiment 3) revealed a striking quadratic relationship
              between the raw complexity of these stimuli and the length of
              their spoken descriptions. In other words, the simplest and most
              complex stimuli received the shortest descriptions, while those
              stimuli with a medium degree of complexity received the longest
              descriptions. Follow-up analyses explored the particular words
              used by subjects, allowing us to further explore how such stimuli
              were represented. We suggest that the mind engages in a kind of
              lossy compression for overly complex stimuli, and we discuss the
              utility of such free-form responses for exploring foundational
              questions about mental representation. (PsycInfo Database Record

              behavior in virtual actors, such as intelligent tutors, creative
              assistants, or team partners. They still lack the ‘magic’ of
              human-level cognition: systems built for one paradigm appear
              clueless outside of its boundary. Natural cognitive systems, on
              the other hand, can adapt to unexpected environments and
              paradigms. To capture the robustness of natural cognitive
              development, a new approach is proposed here that enables the
              formation of new higher cognitive abilities in a model system,
              embedded in an unexpected environment. This is achieved based on
              the naturally developing grounding of innate abstract constructs
              (schemas). The mechanism producing this binding is that of
              creative insight. In this study, principles of insight processes
              borrowed from psychology are formalized and adapted for computer
              modeling. To do this, several examples of insight phenomena at
              different evolutionary levels and in different species are
              analyzed before the model is formulated based on the dual process
              theory, the signal model of insight, and the eBICA cognitive
              architecture framework. Results of its computer simulations prove
              the concept. One specific finding is that the accumulation of
              activation during the incubation period increases creative
              abilities of the system. It is argued that the proposed approach
              can explain a range of facts and mysteries associated with the
              human cognitive ontogeny and can provide the basis for a
              self-sustained evolution of future Artificial Intelligence.",

                   prior resources. It is both visually and linguistically
                   richer, moving beyond whole shape descriptions to include
                   segmentation maps and part labels. We use this resource to
                   evaluate the abstract visual reasoning capacities of recent

                   demonstrate limited abstract reasoning, which dramatically
                   improves with fine-tuning. We also observe that explicitly
                   describing parts aids abstract reasoning for both humans and

              number of studies show that language, and specifically the
              practice of labeling, can exert extremely rapid and pervasive
              effects on putatively non-verbal processes such as categorization,
              visual discrimination, and even simply detecting the presence of a
              stimulus. Progress on the empirical front, however, has not been
              accompanied by progress in understanding the mechanisms by which
              language affects these processes. One puzzle is how effects of
              language can be both deep, in the sense of affecting even basic
              visual processes, and yet vulnerable to manipulations such as
              verbal interference, which can sometimes nullify effects of
              language. In this paper, I review some of the evidence for effects
              of language on cognition and perception, showing that performance
              on tasks that have been presumed to be non-verbal is rapidly
              modulated by language. I argue that a clearer understanding of the
              relationship between language and cognition can be achieved by
              rejecting the distinction between verbal and non-verbal
              representations and by adopting a framework in which language

                   cumulative reward and can straightforwardly be used with
                   nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. The
                   two main challenges are the large number of samples typically
                   required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady
                   improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data.
                   We address the first challenge by using value functions to
                   substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient
                   estimates at the cost of some bias, with an
                   exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function
                   that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second
                   challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for
                   both the policy and the value function, which are represented
                   by neural networks. Our approach yields strong empirical

                   joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and the

                   from prioritized experience replay. By relabeling the goal of

  abstract      = "Large Language Models have shown tremendous performance on a
                   large variety of natural language processing tasks, ranging
                   from text comprehension to common sense reasoning. However,
                   the mechanisms responsible for this success remain opaque,
                   and it is unclear whether LLMs can achieve human-like
                   cognitive capabilities or whether these models are still
                   fundamentally circumscribed. Abstract reasoning is a
                   fundamental task for cognition, consisting of finding and
                   applying a general pattern from few data. Evaluating deep
                   neural architectures on this task could give insight into
                   their potential limitations regarding reasoning and their
                   broad generalisation abilities, yet this is currently an
                   under-explored area. In this paper, we introduce a new
                   benchmark for evaluating language models beyond memorization
                   on abstract reasoning tasks. We perform extensive evaluations
                   of state-of-the-art LLMs, showing that they currently achieve
                   very limited performance in contrast with other natural
                   language tasks, even when applying techniques that have been
                   shown to improve performance on other NLP tasks. We argue
                   that guiding LLM generation to follow causal paths could help
                   improve the generalisation and reasoning abilities of LLMs.",

              of triangles and 798 is categorized by some as an odd number.
              These patterns are observed both in timed and untimed tasks, hold
              for people who can fully express the necessary and sufficient
              conditions for category membership, and for individuals with
              varying levels of education. A sizeable minority of people believe
              that 400 is more even than 798 and that an equilateral triangle is
              the most ``trianglest'' of triangles. Such beliefs predict how
              people instantiate other categories with necessary and sufficient
              conditions, e.g., grandmother. I argue that the distributed and
              graded nature of mental representations means that human
              algorithms, unlike conventional computer algorithms, only
              approximate rule-based classification and never fully abstract
              from the specifics of the input. This input-sensitivity is
              critical to obtaining the kind of cognitive flexibility at which
              humans excel, but comes at the cost of generally poor abilities to
              perform context-free computations. If human algorithms cannot be
              trusted to produce unfuzzy representations of odd numbers,
              triangles, and grandmothers, the idea that they can be trusted to
              do the heavy lifting of moment-to-moment cognition that is

                   window open, she can hypothesize that a thief broke into her
                   house and caused the mess, as the most plausible explanation.
                   While abduction has long been considered to be at the core of
                   how people interpret and read between the lines in natural
                   language (Hobbs et al., 1988), there has been relatively
                   little research in support of abductive natural language
                   inference and generation. We present the first study that
                   investigates the viability of language-based abductive
                   reasoning. We introduce a challenge dataset, ART, that
                   consists of over 20k commonsense narrative contexts and 200k
                   explanations. Based on this dataset, we conceptualize two new

                   answering task for choosing the more likely explanation, and
                   (ii) Abductive NLG: a conditional generation task for
                   explaining given observations in natural language. On
                   Abductive NLI, the best model achieves 68.9\% accuracy, well

               parietal lobe damage. The use of tools and objects can, however,
               be subdivided in several components. The purpose of our study was
               to find out which of these are dependent on parietal lobe
               function. Thirty-eight patients with left brain damage and
               aphasia were examined using tests to assess the retrieval of
               functional knowledge from semantic memory (Functional
               Associations), mechanical problem solving (Novel Tools) and use
               of everyday tools and objects (Common Tools). Voxel-wise analysis
               of magnetic resonance images revealed two regions where lesions
               had a significant impact on the test results. One extended
               rostrally from the central region and ventrally through the
               middle frontal cortex to the dorsal margin of the inferior
               frontal gyrus. The other reached dorsally and caudally from the
               supramarginal gyrus, through the inferior, to superior parietal
               lobe. Whereas the frontal lesions had an adverse influence on all
               experimental tests as well as on the subtests of the Aachen
               Aphasia test, parietal lesions impaired Novel and Common Tools,
               but did not have an adverse effect on the Functional Associates.
               An association between Functional Associations and temporal
               lesions became apparent when patients with only a selective
               deficit in the test were considered, but did not show up in the
               whole group analysis. The parietal influence was as strong for
               the selection as for the use of either novel or common tools,
               although choice of appropriate manual configuration and movements
               was more important for use than for selection. We conclude that
               the contribution of the parietal lobe to tool use concerns
               general principles of tool use rather than knowledge about the
               prototypical use of common tools and objects, and the
               comprehension of mechanical interactions of the tool with other
               tools, recipients or material rather than the selection of grip

               Interestingly, recent neuropsychological evidence indicates that

                   400 evaluation tasks from the original ARC problem set. We
                   estimate that average human performance lies between 73.3\%
                   and 77.2\% correct with a reported empirical average of
                   76.2\% on the training set, and between 55.9\% and 68.9\%
                   correct with a reported empirical average of 64.2\% on the
                   public evaluation set. However, we also find that 790 out of
                   the 800 tasks were solvable by at least one person in three
                   attempts, suggesting that the vast majority of the publicly
                   available ARC tasks are in principle solvable by typical
                   crowd-workers recruited over the internet. Notably, while
                   these numbers are slightly lower than earlier estimates,
                   human performance still greatly exceeds current
                   state-of-the-art approaches for solving ARC. To facilitate
                   research on ARC, we publicly release our dataset, called

              concepts, understanding how familiar parts can combine together to
              form novel objects. In contrast, popular computer vision models
              struggle to make the same types of inferences, requiring more data
              and generalizing less flexibly than people do. Here, we study
              these distinctively human abilities across a range of different
              types of visual composition, examining how people classify and
              generate ``alien figures'' with rich relational structure. We also
              develop a Bayesian program induction model which searches for the
              best programs for generating the candidate visual figures,
              utilizing a large program space containing different compositional
              mechanisms and abstractions. In few shot classification tasks, we
              find that people and the program induction model can make a range
              of meaningful compositional generalizations, with the model
              providing a strong account of the experimental data as well as
              interpretable parameters that reveal human assumptions about the
              factors invariant to category membership (here, to rotation and
              changing part attachment). In few shot generation tasks, both
              people and the models are able to construct compelling novel
              examples, with people behaving in additional structured ways
              beyond the model capabilities, e.g. making choices that complete a
              set or reconfigure existing parts in new ways. To capture these
              additional behavioral patterns, we develop an alternative model
              based on neuro-symbolic program induction: this model also
              composes new concepts from existing parts yet, distinctively, it
              utilizes neural network modules to capture residual statistical
              structure. Together, our behavioral and computational findings
              show how people and models can produce a variety of compositional

               (EF) might play a role in the development of divergent thinking,
               a key component of creativity, by helping children override
               canonical knowledge. PROCEDURE: We examined this possibility in
               two experiments, by manipulating the familiarity of objects used
               in the Alternate Uses test of divergent thinking both
               between-participants (Experiment 1: N = 53 4-year-olds and 50
               6-year-olds) and within-participants (Experiment 2: N = 74
               5-year-olds). FINDINGS: We found evidence that younger children
               generated more and/or more original ideas for novel than familiar
               objects. However, this effect disappeared with age and did not
               depend on child EF. Further, EF was inversely associated with
               divergent thinking, controlling for age, intelligence, and
               income. SIGNIFICANCE: These results call into question a simple
               executive account of children's divergent thinking and suggest
               that, among predominantly White, socioeconomically advantaged
               4-6-year-olds, divergent idea-generation might be a primarily
               bottom-up process that can be hindered by top-down thinking.",

               examine the development of creativity using a ``creative

               which we compare between 4- to 8-year-old children and adults. We
               find that compared to adults, children spend a higher percentage
               of their search exploring, and their exploitation phases are less
               efficient. Moreover, children orient their search to a different

               substrate of highest cognitive functions. Although neurons of the
               PFC are generated before birth, the differentiation of its
               neurons and development of synaptic connections in humans extend
               to the 3rd decade of life. During this period, synapses as well
               as neurotransmitter systems including their receptors and
               transporters, are initially overproduced followed by selective
               elimination. Advanced methods applied to human and animal models,
               enable investigation of the cellular mechanisms and role of
               specific genes, non-coding regulatory elements and signaling
               molecules in control of prefrontal neuronal production and
               phenotypic fate, as well as neuronal migration to establish

               combination with functional assays and immunohistochemical and
               imaging methods reveal roles of neurotransmitter systems during
               maturation of the PFC. Disruption, or even a slight slowing of
               the rate of neuronal production, migration and synaptogenesis by
               genetic or environmental factors, can induce gross as well as
               subtle changes that eventually can lead to cognitive impairment.

               functions necessary for creative thinking. Functional imaging
               studies have repeatedly demonstrated the involvement of PFC in
               creativity tasks. Patient studies have demonstrated that frontal
               damage due to focal lesions or neurodegenerative diseases are
               associated with impairments in various creativity tasks. However,
               against all odds, a series of clinical observations has reported
               the facilitation of artistic production in patients with
               neurodegenerative diseases affecting PFC, such as frontotemporal
               dementia (FTD). An exacerbation of creativity in frontal diseases
               would challenge neuroimaging findings in controls and patients,
               as well as the theoretical role of prefrontal functions in
               creativity processes. To explore this paradox, we reported the
               history of a FTD patient who exhibited the emergence of visual
               artistic productions during the course of the disease. The
               patient produced a large amount of drawings, which have been
               evaluated by a group of professional artists who were blind to
               the diagnosis. We also reviewed the published clinical cases
               reporting a change in the artistic abilities in patients with
               neurological diseases. We attempted to reconcile these clinical
               observations to previous experimental findings by addressing
               several questions raised by our review. For instance, to what
               extent can the cognitive, conative, and affective changes
               following frontal damage explain changes in artistic abilities?
               Does artistic exacerbation truly reflect increased creative
               capacities? These considerations could help to clarify the place
               of creativity-as it has been defined and explored by cognitive

               optimality (Russell \& Subramanian, 1995) to the challenges of
               developing theories of mechanism and behavior. The framework is
               based on the idea that behaviors are generated by cognitive
               mechanisms that are adapted to the structure of not only the
               environment but also the mind and brain itself. We call the
               framework computational rationality to emphasize the
               incorporation of computational mechanism into the definition of
               rational action. Theories are specified as optimal program
               problems, defined by an adaptation environment, a bounded
               machine, and a utility function. Such theories yield different

                   human-like artificial systems, we need to be following an
                   appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define and
                   evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons
                   between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over
                   the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of
                   attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the
                   fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically
                   assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while
                   making apparent the two historical conceptions of
                   intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that
                   in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates
                   towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill
                   exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board
                   games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill
                   at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence,
                   because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and
                   experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow
                   experimenters to ``buy'' arbitrary levels of skills for a
                   system, in a way that masks the system's own generalization
                   power. We then articulate a new formal definition of
                   intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory,
                   describing intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and
                   highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization
                   difficulty, priors, and experience. Using this definition, we
                   propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark
                   should look like. Finally, we present a benchmark closely
                   following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning
                   Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed
                   to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue
                   that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general
                   fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general
                   intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans.",

               be learned from just a few examples. Several decades of research
               have dramatically advanced our understanding of these two aspects
               of concepts. While the richness and speed of concept learning are
               most often studied in isolation, the power of human concepts may
               be best explained through their synthesis. This paper presents a
               large-scale empirical study of one-shot concept learning,
               suggesting that rich generative knowledge in the form of a motor
               program can be induced from just a single example of a novel
               concept. Participants were asked to draw novel handwritten
               characters given a reference form, and we recorded the motor data

               only produced visually similar drawings, but they also showed a
               striking correspondence in their strokes, as measured by their
               number, shape, order, and direction. This suggests that

                   way to capture natural task structure. In a pretraining

  abstract = "Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
              trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict
              cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal
              operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the
              factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we
              develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into
              the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We
              focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a
              scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a
              previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA
              contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes;
              that is, information about where one can and cannot move within
              the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance
              information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward
              computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a
              feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for
              scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene
              images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA.
              Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance
              relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could
              thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of
              affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of
              in silico experiments on this model to gain insights into its
              internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of
              affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information
              at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of
              which have previously been identified as lowlevel stimulus
              preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations
              also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower
              visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in
              the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN
              suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that
              define the layout of the spatial environment, such as
              boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together,
              these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully
              quantitative model that provides insights into its visual
              computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques
              for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis:
              from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the
              modeling of their underlying algorithms.",

              cortical responses to single objects were predicted by the
              statistical ensembles in which they typically occur, and that this
              link between objects and their visual contexts was made most
              strongly in parahippocampal cortex, overlapping with the anterior

              these. We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces
              symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an
              English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such
              processes that producen-order statistical approximations to
              English do not come closer, with increasingn, to matching the
              output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of ``phrase

              from only raw perceptual inputs. Current machine learning
              approaches fall well short of these human standards, although
              different modeling traditions often have complementary strengths.
              Symbolic models can capture the compositional and causal knowledge
              that enables flexible generalization, but they struggle to learn
              from raw inputs, relying on strong abstractions and simplifying
              assumptions. Neural network models can learn directly from raw
              data, but they struggle to capture compositional and causal
              structure and typically must retrain to tackle new tasks. We bring
              together these two traditions to learn generative models of
              concepts that capture rich compositional and causal structure,
              while learning from raw data. We develop a generative
              neuro-symbolic (GNS) model of handwritten character concepts that
              uses the control flow of a probabilistic program, coupled with
              symbolic stroke primitives and a symbolic image renderer, to
              represent the causal and compositional processes by which
              characters are formed. The distributions of parts (strokes), and
              correlations between parts, are modeled with neural network
              subroutines, allowing the model to learn directly from raw data
              and express nonparametric statistical relationships. We apply our
              model to the Omniglot challenge of human-level concept learning,
              using a background set of alphabets to learn an expressive prior
              distribution over character drawings. In a subsequent evaluation,
              our GNS model uses probabilistic inference to learn rich
              conceptual representations from a single training image that
              generalize to 4 unique tasks, succeeding where previous work has

              but not the former are committed to a symbol-level of
              representation, or to a ‘language of thought’: i.e., to
              representational states that have combinatorial syntactic and
              semantic structure. Several arguments for combinatorial structure
              in mental representations are then reviewed. These include
              arguments based on the ‘systematicity’ of mental representation:
              i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit certain
              symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given thought
              implies the ability to entertain thoughts with semantically
              related contents. We claim that such arguments make a powerful
              case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist at the
              cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that
              Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or ‘abstract
              neurological’) structures in which Classical cognitive
              architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard
              arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and
              conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation.
              Résumé Cet articleétudie les différences entre modèles
              connectionistes et modèles classiques de la structure cognitive.
              Nous pensons que, bien que les deux types de modèles stipulent
              l'existence d'états mentaux représentationnels, la différence
              essentielle est que seuls les modèles classiques requièrent
              l'existence d'un niveau de représentation symbolique—un “langage
              de la pensée”—, c'est-à-dire d'états représentationnels possédant
              une structure syntaxique et sémantique. Nous examinons ensuite
              différents arguments qui militent en faveur de l'existence de
              représentations mentales ayant ces propriétés. Certains de ces
              arguments reposent sur la “systématicité” des représentations
              mentales, c'est-à-dire sur le fait que les capacités cognitives
              exhibent toujours certaines symétries, de sorte que la
              capacitéd'entretenir certaines pensées implique la
              capacitéd'entretenir d'autres pensées apparentées par leur contenu
              sémantique. Nous pensons que ces arguments montrent de manière
              convainquante que l'architecture de l'esprit/du cerveau n'est pas
              connectioniste au niveau cognitif. Nous nous demandons ensuite
              s'il est possible d'interpréter le connectionisme comme une
              analyse des structures neuronales (ou des structures neurologiques
              “abstraites”) dans lesquelles est réalisée l'architecture
              cognitive classique. Nous examinons plusieurs des arguments
              avancés habituellement en défense du connectionisme, et en
              concluons que ceux-ci n'ont de sens que dans cette interprétation.",

               machine learning. However such tools for regression and

               Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to
               reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a
               prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new
               theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural
               networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian
               processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model
               uncertainty with dropout NNs – extracting information from
               existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates
               the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without
               sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We
               perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s

                   was correct, we could more easily both understand our own
                   intelligence and build intelligent machines. Just like in
                   physics, the principles themselves would not be sufficient to
                   predict the behavior of complex systems like brains, and
                   substantial computation might be needed to simulate
                   human-like intelligence. This hypothesis would suggest that
                   studying the kind of inductive biases that humans and animals

  abstract = "Contemporary neural networks still fall short of human-level
              generalization, which extends far beyond our direct experiences.
              In this paper, we argue that the underlying cause for this
              shortcoming is their inability to dynamically and flexibly bind
              information that is distributed throughout the network. This
              binding problem affects their capacity to acquire a compositional
              understanding of the world in terms of symbol-like entities (like
              objects), which is crucial for generalizing in predictable and
              systematic ways. To address this issue, we propose a unifying
              framework that revolves around forming meaningful entities from
              unstructured sensory inputs (segregation), maintaining this
              separation of information at a representational level
              (representation), and using these entities to construct new
              inferences, predictions, and behaviors (composition). Our analysis
              draws inspiration from a wealth of research in neuroscience and
              cognitive psychology, and surveys relevant mechanisms from the
              machine learning literature, to help identify a combination of
              inductive biases that allow symbolic information processing to
              emerge naturally in neural networks. We believe that a
              compositional approach to AI, in terms of grounded symbol-like
              representations, is of fundamental importance for realizing
              human-level generalization, and we hope that this paper may
              contribute towards that goal as a reference and inspiration.",

              raises the question of how to automatically determine an
              appropriate model for a dataset. We investigate this question for
              a space of matrix decomposition models which can express a variety
              of widely used models from unsupervised learning. To enable model
              selection, we organize these models into a context-free grammar
              which generates a wide variety of structures through the
              compositional application of a few simple rules. We use our
              grammar to generically and efficiently infer latent components and
              estimate predictive likelihood for nearly 2500 structures using a
              small toolbox of reusable algorithms. Using a greedy search over
              our grammar, we automatically choose the decomposition structure
              from raw data by evaluating only a small fraction of all models.
              The proposed method typically finds the correct structure for
              synthetic data and backs off gracefully to simpler models under
              heavy noise. It learns sensible structures for datasets as diverse

              when the flow of experience is under their control (i.e., learning
              is self-directed). However, the reasons why volitional control
              might result in superior acquisition and the limits to such
              advantages remain poorly understood. In this article, we review
              the issue from both a cognitive and computational perspective. On
              the cognitive side, self-directed learning allows individuals to
              focus effort on useful information they do not yet possess, can
              expose information that is inaccessible via passive observation,
              and may enhance the encoding and retention of materials. On the

              algorithms that can select their own training data is an emerging
              research topic in machine learning. This review argues that recent
              advances in these related fields may offer a fresh theoretical

              been influenced by a range of direct and indirect selection
              pressures for both cognitive and non-cognitive functions and
              capabilities. It has been hypothesized that hominin brain
              expansion was, in part, a correlated response to selection acting
              on aerobic capacity (Raichlen \& Polk, 2013). According to this
              hypothesis, selection for aerobic capacity increased the activity
              of various signaling molecules, including those involved in brain
              growth. One key molecule is brain-derived neurotrophic factor
              (BDNF), a protein that regulates neuronal development, survival,
              and plasticity in mammals. This review updates, partially tests,
              and expands Raichlen and Polk's (2013) hypothesis by evaluating
              evidence for BDNF as a mediator of brain size. Discussion We
              contend that selection for endurance capabilities in a hot climate
              favored changes to muscle composition, mitochondrial dynamics and
              increased energy budget through pathways involving regulation of
              PGC-1α and MEF2 genes, both of which promote BDNF activity. In
              addition, the evolution of hairlessness and the skin's
              thermoregulatory response provide other molecular pathways that
              promote both BDNF activity and neurotransmitter synthesis. We
              discuss how these pathways contributed to the evolution of brain
              size and function in human evolution and propose avenues for
              future research. Our results support Raichlen and Polk's

              board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats

              assumes a strong inductive bias that considers only these
              particular forms, and each form is explicitly provided as initial
              knowledge. Here we introduce a new computational model of how
              organizing structure can be discovered, utilizing a broad
              hypothesis space with a preference for sparse connectivity. Given
              that the inductive bias is more general, the model's initial
              knowledge shows little qualitative resemblance to some of the
              discoveries it supports. As a consequence, the model can also
              learn complex structures for domains that lack intuitive
              description, as well as predict human property induction judgments
              without explicit structural forms. By allowing form to emerge from
              sparsity, our approach clarifies how both the richness and
              flexibility of human conceptual organization can coexist.",

  abstract = "People learn in fast and flexible ways that have not been emulated
              by machines. Once a person learns a new verb “dax,” he or she can
              effortlessly understand how to “dax twice,” “walk and dax,” or
              “dax vigorously.” There have been striking recent improvements in
              machine learning for natural language processing, yet the best
              algorithms require vast amounts of experience and struggle to
              generalize new concepts in compositional ways. To better
              understand these distinctively human abilities, we study the
              compositional skills of people through languagelike instruction
              learning tasks. Our results show that people can learn and use
              novel functional concepts from very few examples (few-shot
              learning), successfully applying familiar functions to novel
              inputs. People can also compose concepts in complex ways that go
              beyond the provided demonstrations. Two additional experiments
              examined the assumptions and inductive biases that people make
              when solving these tasks, revealing three biases: mutual
              exclusivity, one-to-one mappings, and iconic concatenation. We
              discuss the implications for cognitive modeling and the potential
              for building machines with more human-like language learning

              governing a set of previously seen examples, drawing upon

  abstract = "Deep neural networks have become increasingly successful at
              solving classic perception problems such as object recognition,
              semantic segmentation, and scene understanding, often reaching or
              surpassing human-level accuracy. This success is due in part to
              the ability of DNNs to learn useful representations of
              high-dimensional inputs, a problem that humans must also solve. We
              examine the relationship between the representations learned by
              these networks and human psychological representations recovered
              from similarity judgments. We find that deep features learned in
              service of object classification account for a significant amount
              of the variance in human similarity judgments for a set of animal
              images. However, these features do not capture some qualitative
              distinctions that are a key part of human representations. To
              remedy this, we develop a method for adapting deep features to
              align with human similarity judgments, resulting in image
              representations that can potentially be used to extend the scope
              of psychological experiments.",

  abstract = "Each of our theories of mental representation provides some
              insight into how the mind works. However, these insights often
              seem incompatible, as the debates between symbolic, dynamical,
              emergentist, sub-symbolic, and grounded approaches to cognition
              attest. Mental representations—whatever they are—must share many
              features with each of our theories of representation, and yet
              there are few hypotheses about how a synthesis could be possible.
              Here, I develop a theory of the underpinnings of symbolic
              cognition that shows how sub-symbolic dynamics may give rise to
              higher-level cognitive representations of structures, systems of
              knowledge, and algorithmic processes. This theory implements a
              version of conceptual role semantics by positing an internal
              universal representation language in which learners may create
              mental models to capture dynamics they observe in the world. The
              theory formalizes one account of how truly novel conceptual
              content may arise, allowing us to explain how even elementary
              logical and computational operations may be learned from a more
              primitive basis. I provide an implementation that learns to
              represent a variety of structures, including logic, number,
              kinship trees, regular languages, context-free languages, domains
              of theories like magnetism, dominance hierarchies, list
              structures, quantification, and computational primitives like
              repetition, reversal, and recursion. This account is based on
              simple discrete dynamical processes that could be implemented in a
              variety of different physical or biological systems. In
              particular, I describe how the required dynamics can be directly
              implemented in a connectionist framework. The resulting theory
              provides an “assembly language” for cognition, where high-level
              theories of symbolic computation can be implemented in simple
              dynamics that themselves could be encoded in biologically

              We used a novel data-analysis model to quantify the point at which

              main assumptions: When an infant perceives an object (1) moving
              spontaneously and (2) displaying goaldirected action, it will
              interpret the object as intentional and assign to it the unique
              properties of the psychological domain. The key property tested
              was: Do infants attribute value to interactions between
              intentional objects using criteria specified by the model?We
              showed infants (average age 52 weeks) computer-generated
              animations of spontaneously moving “balls,” using looking time in
              a standard habituation/dishabituation paradigm. In two positive
              interactions, one ball either “caressed” another, or “helped” it
              achieve its goal; whereas in two negative interactions, one ball
              either “hit“ another, or “prevented” it from achieving its goal.
              In keeping with predictions of the model, when transferred to a

               this complex behavior. The mesolimbic dopamine system regulates
               motivating and rewarding behavior as well as motor movement.

                 paradigm as a search in the space of term rewriting systems,
                 previously developed as an abstract model of computation. Our
                 model accurately predicts that participants learn some

                 harder concepts more easily using a bootstrapping curriculum

              problem of fundamental importance in all areas of science. The
              appealing scaling properties of neural networks have recently led
              to a surge of interest in differentiable neural network-based
              methods for learning causal structures from data. So far
              differentiable causal discovery has focused on static datasets of

              data-generating process. Our method significantly reduces the
              required number of interactions compared with random intervention
              targeting and is applicable for both discrete and continuous
              optimization formulations of learning the underlying directed
              acyclic graph (DAG) from data. We examine the proposed method
              across a wide range of settings and demonstrate superior

                 Intelligence (AI), after a half-century of AI repeatedly
                 failing to meet expectations. What explains the dramatic change
                 from 20th-century to 21st-century AI, and how can remaining
                 limitations of current AI be overcome? Until now, the widely
                 accepted narrative has attributed the recent progress in AI to
                 technical engineering advances that have yielded massive
                 increases in the quantity of computational resources and
                 training data available to support statistical learning in deep
                 artificial neural networks. Although these quantitative
                 engineering innovations are important, here we show that the
                 latest advances in AI are not solely due to quantitative
                 increases in computing power but also qualitative changes in
                 how that computing power is deployed. These qualitative changes
                 have brought about a new type of computing that we call
                 neurocompositional computing. In neurocompositional computing,
                 neural networks exploit two scientific principles that
                 contemporary theory in cognitive science maintains are
                 simultaneously necessary to enable human-level cognition. The
                 Compositionality Principle asserts that encodings of complex
                 information are structures that are systematically composed
                 from simpler structured encodings. The Continuity Principle
                 states that the encoding and processing of information is
                 formalized with real numbers that vary continuously. These
                 principles have seemed irreconcilable until the recent
                 mathematical discovery that compositionality can be realized
                 not only through the traditional discrete methods of symbolic
                 computing, well developed in 20th-century AI, but also through
                 novel forms of continuous neural computing—neurocompositional
                 computing. The unprecedented progress of 21st-century AI has
                 resulted from the use of limited—first-generation—forms of
                 neurocompositional computing. We show that the new techniques
                 now being deployed in second-generation neurocompositional
                 computing create AI systems that are not only more robust and
                 accurate than current systems, but also more
                 comprehensible—making it possible to diagnose errors in, and
                 exert human control over, artificial neural networks through
                 interpretation of their internal states and direct intervention
                 upon those states. Note: This tutorial is intended for those
