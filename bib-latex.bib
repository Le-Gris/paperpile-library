                   natural language processing and VGG for computer vision,
                   have become effective methods for improving deep learning
                   models without requiring more labeled data. While effective,
                   feature extractors like BERT may be prohibitively large for
                   some deployment scenarios. We explore weight pruning for
                   BERT and ask: how does compression during pre-training
                   affect transfer learning? We find that pruning affects
                   transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of
                   pruning (30-40\%) do not affect pre-training loss or
                   transfer to downstream tasks at all. Medium levels of
                   pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful
                   pre-training information from being transferred to
                   downstream tasks. High levels of pruning additionally
                   prevent models from fitting downstream datasets, leading to
                   further degradation. Finally, we observe that fine-tuning
                   BERT on a specific task does not improve its prunability. We
                   conclude that BERT can be pruned once during pre-training
                   rather than separately for each task without affecting
                   performance.",

                   range of applications in natural language processing.
                   However, they are inefficient and difficult to deploy. In
                   recent years, many compression algorithms have been proposed
                   to increase the implementation efficiency of large
                   Transformer-based models on target hardware. In this work we
                   present a new method for training sparse pre-trained
                   Transformer language models by integrating weight pruning
                   and model distillation. These sparse pre-trained models can
                   be used to transfer learning for a wide range of tasks while
                   maintaining their sparsity pattern. We demonstrate our
                   method with three known architectures to create sparse
                   pre-trained BERT-Base, BERT-Large and DistilBERT. We show

  author        = "Vysogorets, Artem and Kempe, Julia",
  abstract      = "Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with
                   surging interest in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in
                   this domain heavily relies on faithful representation of the
                   sparsity of subnetworks, which has been traditionally
                   computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct
                   sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize
                   unpruned parameters that detached from input or output
                   layers of underlying subnetworks, potentially
                   underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of
                   inactivated connections. While this effect might be
                   negligible for moderately pruned networks (up to 10-100
                   compression rates), we find that it plays an increasing role
                   for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison
                   between different pruning algorithms. For example, we show
                   that effective compression of a randomly pruned
                   LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its
                   direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed
                   when using SynFlow for pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In
                   this work, we adopt the lens of effective sparsity to
                   reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common
                   benchmark architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19,
                   ResNet-18) and discover that their absolute and relative
                   performance changes dramatically in this new and more
                   appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than
                   direct, sparsity, we develop a low-cost extension to most
                   pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with effective
                   sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that
                   random pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across
                   layers performs as well or better than more sophisticated
                   algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et al., 2020].
                   In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of
                   pressure distribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we
                   design novel layerwise sparsity quotas that outperform all
                   existing baselines in the context of random pruning.",

                   tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of
                   text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While
                   typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still
                   requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or
                   tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can
                   generally perform a new language task from only a few
                   examples or from simple instructions - something which
                   current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we
                   show that scaling up language models greatly improves
                   task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching
                   competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
                   approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive
                   language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than
                   any previous non-sparse language model, and test its
                   performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
                   applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with
                   tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text
                   interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong
                   performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
                   question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several
                   tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain
                   adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word
                   in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same
                   time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot
                   learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where
                   GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on
                   large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate

                   difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

                   introduce a framework for giving particular linguistic
                   inductive biases to a neural network model; such a model can
                   then be used to empirically explore the effects of those
                   inductive biases. This framework disentangles universal
                   inductive biases, which are encoded in the initial values of
                   a neural network's parameters, from non-universal factors,
                   which the neural network must learn from data in a given
                   language. The initial state that encodes the inductive
                   biases is found with meta-learning, a technique through
                   which a model discovers how to acquire new languages more
                   easily via exposure to many possible languages. By
                   controlling the properties of the languages that are used
                   during meta-learning, we can control the inductive biases
                   that meta-learning imparts. We demonstrate this framework
                   with a case study based on syllable structure. First, we
                   specify the inductive biases that we intend to give our
                   model, and then we translate those inductive biases into a
                   space of languages from which a model can meta-learn.
                   Finally, using existing analysis techniques, we verify that
                   our approach has imparted the linguistic inductive biases
                   that it was intended to impart.",

                   approach that combines gradient descent with combinatorial
                   search over programs can be a more effective response to
                   these challenges than purely neural methods. Our framework,

                   higher-order combinators to compose a library of neural
                   functions. Our learning algorithm consists of: (1) a

              direct introspective access to higher order cognitive processes.
              Ss are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that
              importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence
              of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected
              the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report
              on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating
              the effects of a stimulus on a response, they do not do so on the
              basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based
              on a priori, implicit causal theories, or judgments about the
              extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a
              given response. This suggests that though people may not be able
              to observe directly their cognitive processes, they will
              sometimes be able to report accurately about them. Accurate
              reports will occur when influential stimuli are salient and are
              plausible causes of the responses they produce, and will not
              occur when stimuli are not salient or are not plausible causes.

                   test their theory via experimentation, and correct the
                   proposition if inconsistency arises. Rounds of such
                   processes continue until the underlying mechanism is found.
                   Towards building machines that can learn and think like
                   people, one natural question for us to ask is: whether the
                   intelligence we achieve today manages to perform such a
                   scientific thinking process, and if any, at what level. In
                   this work, we devise the EST environment for evaluating the
                   scientific thinking ability in artificial agents. Motivated
                   by the stream of research on causal discovery, we build our
                   interactive EST environment based on Blicket detection.

                   with novel observations and asked to figure out all objects'
                   Blicketness. At each time step, the agent proposes new
                   experiments to validate its hypothesis and updates its
                   current belief. By evaluating Reinforcement Learning (RL)
                   agents on both a symbolic and visual version of this task,

  abstract = "Many aspects of our physical environment are hidden. For example,
              it is hard to estimate how heavy an object is from visual
              observation alone. In this paper we examine how people actively
              ``experiment'' within the physical world to discover such latent
              properties. In the first part of the paper, we develop a novel
              framework for the quantitative analysis of the information
              produced by physical interactions. We then describe two
              experiments that present participants with moving objects in
              ``microworlds'' that operate according to continuous
              spatiotemporal dynamics similar to everyday physics (i.e., forces
              of gravity, friction, etc.). Participants were asked to interact
              with objects in the microworlds in order to identify their
              masses, or the forces of attraction/repulsion that governed their
              movement. Using our modeling framework, we find that learners who
              freely interacted with the physical system selectively produced
              evidence that revealed the physical property consistent with
              their inquiry goal. As a result, their inferences were more
              accurate than for passive observers and, in some contexts, for
              yoked participants who watched video replays of an active
              learner's interactions. We characterize active learners' actions
              into a range of micro-experiment strategies and discuss how these
              might be learned or generalized from past experience. The
              technical contribution of this work is the development of a novel
              analytic framework and methodology for the study of interactively
              learning about the physical world. Its empirical contribution is

              Here, we considered two possibilities. First, we test an
              information sampling model, information gain, which values
              interventions that can discriminate between a learner's
              hypotheses (i.e. possible causal structures). We compare this
              discriminatory model to a positive testing strategy that instead
              aims to confirm individual hypotheses. Experiment 1 shows that
              individual behavior is described best by a mixture of these two
              alternatives. In Experiment 2 we find that people are able to
              adaptively alter their behavior and adopt the discriminatory
              model more often after experiencing that the confirmatory
              strategy leads to a subjective performance decrement. In
              Experiment 3, time pressure leads to the opposite effect of
              inducing a change towards the simpler positive testing strategy.
              These findings suggest that there is no single strategy that
              describes how intervention decisions are made. Instead, people

              affects exploration and discovery. In Experiment 1, we
              investigated children's exploratory play after an adult
              pedagogically demonstrated a function of a toy, after an
              interrupted pedagogical demonstration, after a na{\"\i}ve adult
              demonstrated the function, and at baseline. Preschoolers in the
              pedagogical condition focused almost exclusively on the target
              function; by contrast, children in the other conditions explored
              broadly. In Experiment 2, we show that children restrict their
              exploration both after direct instruction to themselves and after
              overhearing direct instruction given to another child; they do
              not show this constraint after observing direct instruction given
              to an adult or after observing a non-pedagogical intentional
              action. We discuss these findings as the result of rational
              inductive biases. In pedagogical contexts, a teacher's failure to
              provide evidence for additional functions provides evidence for
              their absence; such contexts generalize from child to child
              (because children are likely to have comparable states of
              knowledge) but not from adult to child. Thus, pedagogy promotes
              efficient learning but at a cost: children are less likely to

              RT at Time X and accuracy at Time X + 1, and explored the role of

              experience Aha! moments. Our theory posits that during
              problem-solving, in addition to solving the problem, people also
              maintain a metacognitive model of their ability to solve the
              problem as well as a prediction about the time it would take them
              to solve that problem. Aha! moments arise when we experience a
              positive error in this metacognitive prediction, i.e. when we
              solve a problem much faster than we expected to solve it. We
              posit that this metacognitive error is analogous to a positive
              reward prediction error thereby explaining why we feel so good
              after an Aha! moment. We provide support to our theory across
              three large-scale pre-registered experiments on problem solving,
              demonstrating a link between metacognitive prediction errors and
              Aha! moments. These results highlight the importance of
              metacognitive prediction errors and deepen our understanding of

  abstract = "A popular explanation of the human ability for physical reasoning
              is that it depends on a sophisticated ability to perform mental
              simulations. According to this perspective, physical reasoning
              problems are approached by repeatedly simulating relevant aspects
              of a scenario, with noise, and making judgments based on
              aggregation over these simulations. In this paper, we describe
              three core tenets of simulation approaches, theoretical
              commitments that must be present in order for a simulation
              approach to be viable. The identification of these tenets
              threatens the plausibility of simulation as a theory of physical

              know about cognition more generally. To investigate this apparent
              contradiction, we describe three experiments involving simple

  abstract = "An important part of children's social and cognitive development
              is their understanding that people are psychological beings with
              internal, mental states including desire, intention, perception,
              and belief. A full understanding of people as psychological
              beings requires a representational theory of mind (ToM), which is
              an understanding that mental states can faithfully represent
              reality, or misrepresent reality. For the last 35 years,
              researchers have relied on false-belief tasks as the gold
              standard to test children's understanding that beliefs can
              misrepresent reality. In false-belief tasks, children are asked
              to reason about the behavior of agents who have false beliefs
              about situations. Although a large body of evidence indicates
              that most children pass false-belief tasks by the end of the
              preschool years, the evidence we present in this monograph
              suggests that most children do not understand false beliefs or,
              surprisingly, even true beliefs until middle childhood. We argue
              that young children pass false-belief tasks without understanding
              false beliefs by using perceptual access reasoning (PAR). With
              PAR, children understand that seeing leads to knowing in the
              moment, but not that knowing also arises from thinking or
              persists as memory and belief after the situation changes. By the
              same token, PAR leads children to fail true-belief tasks. PAR
              theory can account for performance on other traditional tests of
              representational ToM and related tasks, and can account for the
              factors that have been found to correlate with or affect both
              true- and false-belief performance. The theory provides a new
              laboratory measure which we label the belief understanding scale
              (BUS). This scale can distinguish between a child who is
              operating with PAR versus a child who is understanding beliefs.
              This scale provides a method needed to allow the study of the
              development of representational ToM. In this monograph, we report
              the outcome of the tests that we have conducted of predictions
              generated by PAR theory. The findings demonstrated signature PAR
              limitations in reasoning about the mind during the ages when
              children are hypothesized to be using PAR. In Chapter II,
              secondary analyses of the published true-belief literature
              revealed that children failed several types of true-belief tasks.
              Chapters III through IX describe new empirical data collected
              across multiple studies between 2003 and 2014 from 580 children
              aged 4-7 years, as well as from a small sample of 14 adults.
              Participants were recruited from the Phoenix, Arizona
              metropolitan area. All participants were native English-speakers.
              Children were recruited from university-sponsored and community
              preschools and daycare centers, and from hospital maternity
              wards. Adults were university students who participated to
              partially fulfill course requirements for research participation.
              Sociometric data were collected only in Chapter IX, and are fully
              reported there. In Chapter III, minor alterations in task
              procedures produced wide variations in children's performance in
              3-option false-belief tasks. In Chapter IV, we report findings
              which show that the developmental lag between children's
              understanding ignorance and understanding false belief is longer
              than the lag reported in previous studies. In Chapter V, children
              did not distinguish between agents who have false beliefs versus
              agents who have no beliefs. In Chapter VI, findings showed that
              children found it no easier to reason about true beliefs than to
              reason about false beliefs. In Chapter VII, when children were
              asked to justify their correct answers in false-belief tasks,
              they did not reference agents' false beliefs. Similarly, in
              Chapter VIII, when children were asked to explain agents' actions
              in false-belief tasks, they did not reference agents' false
              beliefs. In Chapter IX, children who were identified as using PAR
              differed from children who understood beliefs along three
              dimensions-in levels of social development, inhibitory control,
              and kindergarten adjustment. Although the findings need
              replication and additional studies of alternative
              interpretations, the collection of results reported in this
              monograph challenges the prevailing view that representational
              ToM is in place by the end of the preschool years. Furthermore,
              the pattern of findings is consistent with the proposal that PAR
              is the developmental precursor of representational ToM. The
              current findings also raise questions about claims that infants
              and toddlers demonstrate ToM-related abilities, and that
              representational ToM is innate.",

               of the person on the street and the tacit knowledge underlying
               the quantitative knowledge used by engineers and scientists. The
               key to qualitative physics is to find ways to represent
               continuous properties of the world by discrete systems of
               symbols. One can always quantize something continuous, but not
               all quantizations are equally useful. One way to state the idea
               is the relevance principle: The distinctions made by a
               quantization must be relevant to the kind of reasoning
               performed. This chapter describes what qualitative physics is,
               why one should be doing it, and where it came from. It discusses

  abstract = "In rule-based (RB) category-learning tasks, the optimal strategy
              is a simple explicit rule, whereas in information-integration
              (II) tasks, the optimal strategy is impossible to describe
              verbally. This study investigates the effects of two different
              category properties on learning difficulty in category learning
              tasks-namely, linear separability and variability on stimulus
              dimensions that are irrelevant to the categorization decision.
              Previous research had reported that linearly separable II
              categories are easier to learn than nonlinearly separable
              categories, but Experiment 1, which compared performance on
              linearly and nonlinearly separable categories that were equated
              as closely as possible on all other factors that might affect
              difficulty, found that linear separability had no effect on
              learning. Experiments 1 and 2 together also established a novel
              dissociation between RB and II category learning: increasing
              variability on irrelevant stimulus dimensions impaired II
              learning but not RB learning. These results are all predicted by
              the best available measures of difficulty in RB and II tasks.

  author   = "Wilson, Andrew D and Golonka, Sabrina",
  abstract = "The most exciting hypothesis in cognitive science right now is
              the theory that cognition is embodied. Like all good ideas in
              cognitive science, however, embodiment immediately came to mean
              six different things. The most common definitions involve the
              straight-forward claim that ``states of the body modify states of
              the mind.'' However, the implications of embodiment are actually
              much more radical than this. If cognition can span the brain,
              body, and the environment, then the ``states of mind'' of
              disembodied cognitive science won't exist to be modified.
              Cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a
              broad array of resources. Taking embodiment seriously therefore
              requires both new methods and theory. Here we outline four key
              steps that research programs should follow in order to fully
              engage with the implications of embodiment. The first step is to
              conduct a task analysis, which characterizes from a first person
              perspective the specific task that a perceiving-acting cognitive
              agent is faced with. The second step is to identify the
              task-relevant resources the agent has access to in order to solve
              the task. These resources can span brain, body, and environment.
              The third step is to identify how the agent can assemble these
              resources into a system capable of solving the problem at hand.
              The last step is to test the agent's performance to confirm that
              agent is actually using the solution identified in step 3. We
              explore these steps in more detail with reference to two useful
              examples (the outfielder problem and the A-not-B error), and
              introduce how to apply this analysis to the thorny question of
              language use. Embodied cognition is more than we think it is, and
              we have the tools we need to realize its full potential.",

              methods suggested by prior experience and the problem solver

  author    = "Elman, Jeffrey L",
  abstract  = "Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the
               question of how to represent time in connectionist models is
               very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by
               its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a
               spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal
               along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which
               involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks
               with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns
               are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which
               develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior
               internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range
               from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to
               discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks
               are able to learn interesting internal representations which
               incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this
               approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task
               processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which
               allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing
               generalizations across classes of items. These representations

                   they interact with one another. To partition images into
                   entities, deep-learning researchers have proposed structural
                   inductive biases such as slot-based architectures. To model
                   interactions among entities, equivariant graph neural nets
                   (GNNs) are used, but these are not particularly well suited
                   to the task for two reasons. First, GNNs do not predispose
                   interactions to be sparse, as relationships among
                   independent entities are likely to be. Second, GNNs do not
                   factorize knowledge about interactions in an
                   entity-conditional manner. As an alternative, we take
                   inspiration from cognitive science and resurrect a classic
                   approach, production systems, which consist of a set of rule
                   templates that are applied by binding placeholder variables
                   in the rules to specific entities. Rules are scored on their

              While these modalities are typically studied independently, we
              take a comparative approach and ask when and why one modality
              might outperform another. We present a series of real-time,
              multi-player experiments asking participants to teach concepts
              using either demonstrations or language. Our first experiment
              (N=416) asks when language might outperform demonstration. We
              manipulate the complexity of the concept being taught and find
              that language communicates complex concepts more effectively than
              demonstration. We then ask why language succeeds in this setting.
              We hypothesized that language allowed teachers to reference
              abstract object features (e.g., shapes and colors), while
              demonstration teachers could only provide concrete examples
              (specific positive or negative objects). To test this hypothesis,
              our second experiment (N=568) ablated object features from the
              teacher's interface. This manipulation severely impaired

  abstract = "One of the most striking features of human cognition is the
              ability to plan. Two aspects of human planning stand out-its
              efficiency and flexibility. Efficiency is especially impressive
              because plans must often be made in complex environments, and yet
              people successfully plan solutions to many everyday problems
              despite having limited cognitive resources1-3. Standard accounts
              in psychology, economics and artificial intelligence have
              suggested that human planning succeeds because people have a
              complete representation of a task and then use heuristics to plan
              future actions in that representation4-11. However, this approach
              generally assumes that task representations are fixed. Here we
              propose that task representations can be controlled and that such
              control provides opportunities to quickly simplify problems and
              more easily reason about them. We propose a computational account
              of this simplification process and, in a series of preregistered
              behavioural experiments, show that it is subject to online
              cognitive control12-14 and that people optimally balance the
              complexity of a task representation and its utility for planning
              and acting. These results demonstrate how strategically

                   remains an open challenge for robotics. In this work, we
                   propose self-supervising control on top of human
                   teleoperated play data as a way to scale up skill learning.
                   Play has two properties that make it attractive compared to
                   conventional task demonstrations. Play is cheap, as it can
                   be collected in large quantities quickly without task
                   segmenting, labeling, or resetting to an initial state. Play
                   is naturally rich, covering ~4x more interaction space than
                   task demonstrations for the same amount of collection time.
                   To learn control from play, we introduce Play-LMP, a
                   self-supervised method that learns to organize play
                   behaviors in a latent space, then reuse them at test time to
                   achieve specific goals. Combining self-supervised control
                   with a diverse play dataset shifts the focus of skill
                   learning from a narrow and discrete set of tasks to the full
                   continuum of behaviors available in an environment. We find
                   that this combination generalizes well empirically---after
                   self-supervising on unlabeled play, our method substantially
                   outperforms individual expert-trained policies on 18
                   difficult user-specified visual manipulation tasks in a
                   simulated robotic tabletop environment. We additionally find
                   that play-supervised models, unlike their expert-trained
                   counterparts, are more robust to perturbations and exhibit
                   retrying-till-success behaviors. Finally, we find that our
                   agent organizes its latent plan space around functional
                   tasks, despite never being trained with task labels. Videos,

              defined over two dimensions and then classified test items in
              distant transfer regions of the category space. The paradigm

  abstract = "The insightful problem-solving process has been proposed to
              involve three main phases: an initial representation phase, in
              which the solver inappropriately represents the problem; an
              initial search through the faulty problem space that may lead to
              impasse; and a postimpasse restructuring phase. Some theories
              propose that the restructuring phase involves controlled search
              processes, whereas other theories propose that restructuring is
              achieved through the automatic redistribution of activation in
              long-term memory. In this study, we used correlations between
              working memory (WM) span measures and problem-solving success to
              test the predictions of these different theories. One group of
              participants received a set of insight problems that allowed for
              a large initial faulty search space, whereas another group
              received a matched set that constrained the initial faulty search
              space in order to isolate the restructuring phase of the
              insightful process. The results suggest that increased ability to
              control attention (as measured by WM span tasks) predicts an
              individual's ability to successfully solve problems that involve
              both the initial search phase and the restructuring phase.
              However, individual differences in ability to control attention
              do not predict success on problems that isolate the restructuring

              sudden realization how to solve it. Two contemporary theories
              have been proposed to explain insight. The representational
              change theory (e.g., G. Knoblich, S. Ohlsson, \& G. E. Rainey,
              2001) proposes that insight occurs through relaxing self-imposed
              constraints on a problem and by decomposing chunked items in the
              problem. The progress monitoring theory (e.g., J. N. MacGregor,

              only sought once it becomes apparent that the distance to the
              goal is unachievable in the moves remaining. These 2 theories are
              tested in an unlimited move problem, to which neither theory has
              previously been applied. The results lend support to both, but
              experimental manipulations to the problem suggest that the
              representational change theory is the better indicator of

              the necessity to overcome the constraint that a solution can be

  abstract = "The disambiguation of a syntactically ambiguous sentence in favor
              of a less preferred parse can lead to slower reading at the
              disambiguation point. This phenomenon, referred to as a
              garden-path effect, has motivated models in which readers
              initially maintain only a subset of the possible parses of the
              sentence, and subsequently require time-consuming reanalysis to
              reconstruct a discarded parse. A more recent proposal argues that
              the garden-path effect can be reduced to surprisal arising in a
              fully parallel parser: words consistent with the initially
              dispreferred but ultimately correct parse are simply less
              predictable than those consistent with the incorrect parse. Since
              predictability has pervasive effects in reading far beyond
              garden-path sentences, this account, which dispenses with
              reanalysis mechanisms, is more parsimonious. Crucially, it
              predicts a linear effect of surprisal: the garden-path effect is
              expected to be proportional to the difference in word surprisal
              between the ultimately correct and ultimately incorrect
              interpretations. To test this prediction, we used recurrent
              neural network language models to estimate word-by-word surprisal
              for three temporarily ambiguous constructions. We then estimated
              the slowdown attributed to each bit of surprisal from human
              self-paced reading times, and used that quantity to predict
              syntactic disambiguation difficulty. Surprisal successfully
              predicted the existence of garden-path effects, but drastically
              underpredicted their magnitude, and failed to predict their
              relative severity across constructions. We conclude that a full

                   when the structure is disambiguated in favor of the less
                   preferred alternative. Surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy,
                   2008), a prominent explanation of this finding, proposes
                   that these slowdowns are due to the unpredictability of each
                   of the words that occur in these sentences. Challenging this

                   human garden path effects. In this work, we consider whether
                   this underestimation is due to the fact that humans weight
                   syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than
                   language models do. We propose a method for estimating
                   syntactic predictability from a language model, allowing us
                   to weigh the cost of lexical and syntactic predictability

                   predictability independently from lexical predictability
                   indeed results in larger estimates of garden path. At the
                   same time, even when syntactic predictability is
                   independently weighted, surprisal still greatly
                   underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects.
                   Our results support the hypothesis that predictability is

  abstract = "The dominant paradigm of experiments in the social and behavioral
              sciences views an experiment as a test of a theory, where the
              theory is assumed to generalize beyond the experiment's specific
              conditions. According to this view, which Alan Newell once
              characterized as ``playing twenty questions with nature,'' theory
              is advanced one experiment at a time, and the integration of
              disparate findings is assumed to happen via the scientific
              publishing process. In this article, we argue that the process of
              integration is at best inefficient, and at worst it does not, in
              fact, occur. We further show that the challenge of integration
              cannot be adequately addressed by recently proposed reforms that
              focus on the reliability and replicability of individual
              findings, nor simply by conducting more or larger experiments.
              Rather, the problem arises from the imprecise nature of social
              and behavioral theories and, consequently, a lack of
              commensurability across experiments conducted under different
              conditions. Therefore, researchers must fundamentally rethink how
              they design experiments and how the experiments relate to theory.
              We specifically describe an alternative framework, integrative
              experiment design, which intrinsically promotes commensurability
              and continuous integration of knowledge. In this paradigm,
              researchers explicitly map the design space of possible
              experiments associated with a given research question, embracing
              many potentially relevant theories rather than focusing on just
              one. The researchers then iteratively generate theories and test
              them with experiments explicitly sampled from the design space,
              allowing results to be integrated across experiments. Given
              recent methodological and technological developments, we conclude
              that this approach is feasible and would generate more-reliable,

                   labels) given natural language descriptions. To learn a new
                   concept (e.g. a classifier), we search directly in the space
                   of descriptions to minimize the interpreter's loss on
                   training examples. Crucially, our models do not require
                   language data to learn these concepts: language is used only
                   in pretraining to impose structure on subsequent learning.

  abstract = "Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
              trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict
              cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the
              internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and
              the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we
              develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into
              the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We
              focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a
              scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a
              previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the
              OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of
              scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move
              within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this
              affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely
              feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep
              CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously
              trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the
              CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in
              the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA
              variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The
              CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of
              affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of
              in silico experiments on this model to gain insights into its
              internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation
              of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual
              information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal
              orientations, both of which have previously been identified as
              lowlevel stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex.
              These computations also exhibited a strong preference for
              information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with
              known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature
              selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based
              responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial
              environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large
              extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory
              functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that
              provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly,
              they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual
              cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification
              of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying

              machine learning and fMRI to test the hypothesis that object

              and elicited by the perception of individual objects. We
              identified low-dimensional representations that capture the
              latent statistical structure of object co-occurrence in
              real-world scenes, and we mapped these statistical
              representations onto voxel-wise fMRI responses during object
              viewing. We found that cortical responses to single objects were
              predicted by the statistical ensembles in which they typically
              occur, and that this link between objects and their visual
              contexts was made most strongly in parahippocampal cortex,
              overlapping with the anterior portion of scene-selective

                   more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following
                   an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define
                   and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons
                   between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans.
                   Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of
                   attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the
                   fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically
                   assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while
                   making apparent the two historical conceptions of
                   intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that
                   in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates
                   towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill
                   exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks, such as board
                   games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill
                   at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence,
                   because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and
                   experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data
                   allow experimenters to ``buy'' arbitrary levels of skills
                   for a system, in a way that masks the system's own
                   generalization power. We then articulate a new formal
                   definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information
                   Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition
                   efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope,
                   generalization difficulty, priors, and experience, as
                   critical pieces to be accounted for in characterizing
                   intelligent systems. Using this definition, we propose a set
                   of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look
                   like. Finally, we present a new benchmark closely following
                   these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus
                   (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be
                   as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that
                   ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general
                   fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general

              can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular
              subclass of such processes that producen-order statistical
              approximations to English do not come closer, with increasingn,
              to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the

              powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type

               but its extent, nature and determinants have proved

               generalisation benefits from training regimes in which items are

  abstract = "People can learn rich, general-purpose conceptual representations
              from only raw perceptual inputs. Current machine learning
              approaches fall well short of these human standards, although
              different modeling traditions often have complementary strengths.
              Symbolic models can capture the compositional and causal
              knowledge that enables flexible generalization, but they struggle
              to learn from raw inputs, relying on strong abstractions and
              simplifying assumptions. Neural network models can learn directly
              from raw data, but they struggle to capture compositional and
              causal structure and typically must retrain to tackle new tasks.
              We bring together these two traditions to learn generative models
              of concepts that capture rich compositional and causal structure,
              while learning from raw data. We develop a generative
              neuro-symbolic (GNS) model of handwritten character concepts that
              uses the control flow of a probabilistic program, coupled with
              symbolic stroke primitives and a symbolic image renderer, to
              represent the causal and compositional processes by which
              characters are formed. The distributions of parts (strokes), and
              correlations between parts, are modeled with neural network
              subroutines, allowing the model to learn directly from raw data
              and express nonparametric statistical relationships. We apply our
              model to the Omniglot challenge of human-level concept learning,
              using a background set of alphabets to learn an expressive prior
              distribution over character drawings. In a subsequent evaluation,
              our GNS model uses probabilistic inference to learn rich
              conceptual representations from a single training image that
              generalize to 4 unique tasks, succeeding where previous work has
              fallen short.",

  abstract = "This paper explores differences between Connectionist proposals
              for cognitive architecture and the sorts of models that have
              traditionally been assumed in cognitive science. We claim that
              the major distinction is that, while both Connectionist and
              Classical architectures postulate representational mental states,
              the latter but not the former are committed to a symbol-level of
              representation, or to a `language of thought': i.e., to
              representational states that have combinatorial syntactic and
              semantic structure. Several arguments for combinatorial structure
              in mental representations are then reviewed. These include
              arguments based on the `systematicity' of mental representation:
              i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit
              certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given
              thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with
              semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make
              a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist
              at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that
              Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or `abstract
              neurological') structures in which Classical cognitive
              architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard
              arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and
              conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation.

              repr{\'e}sentationnels, la diff{\'e}rence essentielle est que

              repr{\'e}sentationnels poss{\'e}dant une structure syntaxique et

              qui militent en faveur de l'existence de repr{\'e}sentations
              mentales ayant ces propri{\'e}t{\'e}s. Certains de ces arguments
              reposent sur la ``syst{\'e}maticit{\'e}'' des repr{\'e}sentations
              mentales, c'est-{\`a}-dire sur le fait que les capacit{\'e}s
              cognitives exhibent toujours certaines sym{\'e}tries, de sorte
              que la capacit{\'e}d'entretenir certaines pens{\'e}es implique la
              capacit{\'e}d'entretenir d'autres pens{\'e}es apparent{\'e}es par

               reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a
               prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new

              typically combine multiple low-level image features with
              high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and
              scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision
              (mAP) by more than 30\% relative to the previous best result on
              VOC 2012---achieving a mAP of 53.3\%. Our approach combines two
              key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional
              neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to
              localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data

                   was correct, we could more easily both understand our own
                   intelligence and build intelligent machines. Just like in
                   physics, the principles themselves would not be sufficient
                   to predict the behavior of complex systems like brains, and
                   substantial computation might be needed to simulate
                   human-like intelligence. This hypothesis would suggest that
                   studying the kind of inductive biases that humans and

              generalization, which extends far beyond our direct experiences.
              In this paper, we argue that the underlying cause for this
              shortcoming is their inability to dynamically and flexibly bind
              information that is distributed throughout the network. This
              binding problem affects their capacity to acquire a compositional
              understanding of the world in terms of symbol-like entities (like
              objects), which is crucial for generalizing in predictable and
              systematic ways. To address this issue, we propose a unifying
              framework that revolves around forming meaningful entities from
              unstructured sensory inputs (segregation), maintaining this
              separation of information at a representational level
              (representation), and using these entities to construct new
              inferences, predictions, and behaviors (composition). Our
              analysis draws inspiration from a wealth of research in
              neuroscience and cognitive psychology, and surveys relevant
              mechanisms from the machine learning literature, to help identify
              a combination of inductive biases that allow symbolic information
              processing to emerge naturally in neural networks. We believe
              that a compositional approach to AI, in terms of grounded
              symbol-like representations, is of fundamental importance for
              realizing human-level generalization, and we hope that this paper

              been influenced by a range of direct and indirect selection
              pressures for both cognitive and non-cognitive functions and
              capabilities. It has been hypothesized that hominin brain
              expansion was, in part, a correlated response to selection acting
              on aerobic capacity (Raichlen \& Polk, 2013). According to this
              hypothesis, selection for aerobic capacity increased the activity
              of various signaling molecules, including those involved in brain
              growth. One key molecule is brain-derived neurotrophic factor
              (BDNF), a protein that regulates neuronal development, survival,
              and plasticity in mammals. This review updates, partially tests,
              and expands Raichlen and Polk's (2013) hypothesis by evaluating
              evidence for BDNF as a mediator of brain size. Discussion We
              contend that selection for endurance capabilities in a hot
              climate favored changes to muscle composition, mitochondrial
              dynamics and increased energy budget through pathways involving
              regulation of PGC-1$\alpha$ and MEF2 genes, both of which promote
              BDNF activity. In addition, the evolution of hairlessness and the
              skin's thermoregulatory response provide other molecular pathways
              that promote both BDNF activity and neurotransmitter synthesis.
              We discuss how these pathways contributed to the evolution of
              brain size and function in human evolution and propose avenues

               However, most studies have focused on aerobic and resistant
               forms of exercise. The purpose of this study was to compare the
               effect of `open-skill' with `closed-skill' exercise (defined in
               terms of the predictability of the performing environment) on
               brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) production and task
               switching performance. Twenty young adult males participated in
               both closed (running) and open (badminton) skill exercise
               sessions in a counterbalanced order on separate days. The
               exercise sessions consisted of 5 min of warm up exercises
               followed by 30 min of running or badminton. The exercise
               intensity was set at 60\% ($\pm$5\%) of the heart rate reserve
               level (HRR) with HR being monitored by a wireless heart rate
               monitor. Blood samples were taken and participation in a
               task-switching paradigm occurred before and after each exercise
               session. Results showed no differences in serum BDNF or
               task-switching performance at the pre-test stage, however,
               badminton exercise resulted in significantly higher serum BDNF
               levels (a proxy for levels of BDNF in the brain) and near
               significant smaller global switching costs relative to running.
               This study has provided preliminary evidence in support the

              board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats

              probabilistic inference about the right structural form---where
              form could be a tree, ring, chain, grid, etc. (Kemp \& Tenenbaum,
              2008). Although this approach can learn intuitive organizations,
              including a tree for animals and a ring for the color circle, it
              assumes a strong inductive bias that considers only these
              particular forms, and each form is explicitly provided as initial

              organizing structure can be discovered, utilizing a broad
              hypothesis space with a preference for sparse connectivity. Given
              that the inductive bias is more general, the model's initial

              discoveries it supports. As a consequence, the model can also
              learn complex structures for domains that lack intuitive

              have dramatically advanced our understanding of these two aspects

              large-scale empirical study of one-shot concept learning,
              suggesting that rich generative knowledge in the form of a motor
              program can be induced from just a single example of a novel

              the ability of DNNs to learn useful representations of

              We examine the relationship between the representations learned

  abstract = "Each of our theories of mental representation provides some
              insight into how the mind works. However, these insights often
              seem incompatible, as the debates between symbolic, dynamical,
              emergentist, sub-symbolic, and grounded approaches to cognition
              attest. Mental representations---whatever they are---must share
              many features with each of our theories of representation, and
              yet there are few hypotheses about how a synthesis could be
              possible. Here, I develop a theory of the underpinnings of
              symbolic cognition that shows how sub-symbolic dynamics may give
              rise to higher-level cognitive representations of structures,
              systems of knowledge, and algorithmic processes. This theory
              implements a version of conceptual role semantics by positing an
              internal universal representation language in which learners may
              create mental models to capture dynamics they observe in the
              world. The theory formalizes one account of how truly novel
              conceptual content may arise, allowing us to explain how even
              elementary logical and computational operations may be learned
              from a more primitive basis. I provide an implementation that
              learns to represent a variety of structures, including logic,
              number, kinship trees, regular languages, context-free languages,
              domains of theories like magnetism, dominance hierarchies, list
              structures, quantification, and computational primitives like
              repetition, reversal, and recursion. This account is based on
              simple discrete dynamical processes that could be implemented in
              a variety of different physical or biological systems. In
              particular, I describe how the required dynamics can be directly
              implemented in a connectionist framework. The resulting theory
              provides an ``assembly language'' for cognition, where high-level
              theories of symbolic computation can be implemented in simple
              dynamics that themselves could be encoded in biologically

              interpret the object as intentional and assign to it the unique
              properties of the psychological domain. The key property tested
              was: Do infants attribute value to interactions between
              intentional objects using criteria specified by the model?We
              showed infants (average age 52 weeks) computer-generated
              animations of spontaneously moving ``balls,'' using looking time

               improve health. Thus, understanding the molecular factors that

               imperative for the development of strategies to reduce sedentary
               behavior and in turn prevent chronic disease. Despite many of

               dopamine system regulates motivating and rewarding behavior as
               well as motor movement. Here, we present data supporting the
               hypothesis that obesity may mechanistically lower voluntary

               so, we review data that suggests mesolimbic dopamine activity is
               a strong contributor to voluntary physical activity behavior. We
               also summarize findings suggesting that obesity leads to central
               dopaminergic dysfunction, which in turn contributes to
               reductions in physical activity that often accompany obesity.
               Additionally, we highlight examples in which central leptin
               activity influences physical activity levels in a
               dopamine-dependent manner. Future elucidation of these

  abstract = "Recent experiments show that preverbal infants can reason
              probabilistically. This raises a deep puzzle because infants lack
              the counting and dividing abilities presumably required to
              compute probabilities. In the standard way of computing
              probabilities, they would have to count or accurately estimate
              large frequencies and divide those values by their total. Here,
              we present a novel neural-network model that learns and uses
              probability distributions without explicit counting or dividing.
              Probability distributions emerge naturally from neural-network
              learning of event sequences, providing a computationally
              sufficient explanation of how infants could succeed at
              probabilistic reasoning. Several alternative explanations are
              discussed and ruled out. Our work bears on several other active
              literatures, and it suggests an effective way to integrate
              Bayesian and neural-network approaches to cognition.",

  abstract    = "The past decade has produced a revolution in Artificial
                 Intelligence (AI), after a half-century of AI repeatedly
                 failing to meet expectations. What explains the dramatic
                 change from 20th-century to 21st-century AI, and how can
                 remaining limitations of current AI be overcome? Until now,
                 the widely accepted narrative has attributed the recent
                 progress in AI to technical engineering advances that have
                 yielded massive increases in the quantity of computational
                 resources and training data available to support statistical
                 learning in deep artificial neural networks. Although these
                 quantitative engineering innovations are important, here we
                 show that the latest advances in AI are not solely due to
                 quantitative increases in computing power but also qualitative
                 changes in how that computing power is deployed. These
                 qualitative changes have brought about a new type of computing
                 that we call neurocompositional computing. In
                 neurocompositional computing, neural networks exploit two
                 scientific principles that contemporary theory in cognitive
                 science maintains are simultaneously necessary to enable
                 human-level cognition. The Compositionality Principle asserts
                 that encodings of complex information are structures that are
                 systematically composed from simpler structured encodings. The
                 Continuity Principle states that the encoding and processing
                 of information is formalized with real numbers that vary
                 continuously. These principles have seemed irreconcilable
                 until the recent mathematical discovery that compositionality
                 can be realized not only through the traditional discrete
                 methods of symbolic computing, well developed in 20th-century
                 AI, but also through novel forms of continuous neural
                 computing---neurocompositional computing. The unprecedented
                 progress of 21st-century AI has resulted from the use of
                 limited---first-generation---forms of neurocompositional
                 computing. We show that the new techniques now being deployed
                 in second-generation neurocompositional computing create AI
                 systems that are not only more robust and accurate than
                 current systems, but also more comprehensible---making it
                 possible to diagnose errors in, and exert human control over,
                 artificial neural networks through interpretation of their
                 internal states and direct intervention upon those states.

              sophistication, they have some drawbacks at a more integrative,
              ``architectural'' level of analysis. We describe a ``hybrid''
              cognitive architecture that is implementable in neuronal nets,
              and which has uniform brainlike features, including
              activation-passing and highly distributed ``codelets,''
